TZUNAMI DEPLOYER OVERVIEW

Tzunami Deployer is the leading tool for rapid migration and consolidation of content from
multiple sources into Microsoft SharePoint Products and Technologies.

Tzunami Deployer enables organizations that wish to start using or upgrading their
SharePoint to dramatically reduce migration costs. Using Tzunami Deployer, the time
required for a SharePoint content migration project is significantly reduced compared to the
traditional labor-intensive processes.

Tzunami Deployer enables you to prepare modeling and migration plans offline and even
off-site. Any changes performed in Tzunami Deployer do not actually affect the SharePoint
server until you choose to commit them. For more information about Microsoft SharePoint
Products and Technologies, refer to: http://www.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default.mspx.

Key Features

Easy to use— Similar to the windows file explorer, Tzunami Deployer has a
familiar, tree-based, drag and drop user interface.

Migrates all List Types— Custom Lists, Document Libraries, Folders, Issues,
Task, Contacts, Announcements, Discussions, Web Part, Home Page, Quick
Launch, Wiki Site, Content Type etc. can all be migrated while preserving
views, metadata, and user-edit information.

Copying contents within SharePoint servers— Tzunami Deployer supports
the copying of content between and within SPS2013/SPF2013, Office 365,
SPS2010/SPF2010, MOSS/WSS3.0 and SPS2003/WSS2.0 servers, sites and
lists.

Modeling and deploying tool— Leading tool for modeling, customizing, and
designing SharePoint sites, lists, libraries, and folders etc. as well as
managing security settings.

Metadata editing and mapping— Tzunami Deployer’s metadata editing and
mapping features provides a central point for metadata administration for
all SharePoint sites.

Retain your valuable data— When deploying content to SharePoint, Tzunami
Deployer maps metadata properties of source items to target columns in
SharePoint libraries and lists. If no appropriate columns exist in the target to
host your source properties, you can create them on the spot.

Migrate permission— When migrating content into SharePoint, Tzunami
Deployer analyzes security permissions in the content sources and allows
mapping of source users, roles and permissions to corresponding
SharePoint users, groups, roles and permissions in order to best match the
existing settings.

Offline simulation environment-— Tzunami Deployer loads all source and
target information into a Tzunami Deployer project. This enables Tzunami
Deployer to be used to make modifications and deployment plans even
when it is not connected to either the source or the target machines.

All modification and deployment actions performed in Tzunami Deployer are
not executed immediately. Rather, these changes are recorded in a Tzunami
Deployer project. You can duplicate a Tzunami Deployer project to create
several modeling and deployment scenarios, and choose the one best suited
for your needs.

Tzunami Deployer only applies the changes to the target location and
uploads the content from the source locations when you perform the
committing stage.

Page | 1-4
All changes performed by Tzunami Deployer are done through the
supported SharePoint API’s. Tzunami Deployer does not perform any
unsupported direct writes to the SharePoint databases.

LICENSING INFORMATION

There are currently two types of licenses.

Evaluation License: Each Tzunami Deployer and Exporters are installed with a
default evaluation license which limits the number of items that can be migrated
from each container. Refer to Tzunami Deployer Licensing Service Guide for more
Details.

Full License: This type of license determines the amount of data that can be
migrated from the source system to the target SharePoint. When committing
content to the target SharePoint, Tzunami Deployer Remote Service communicates
with Tzunami Licensing Service to check the availability of license.

Tzunami Deployer Licensing Service provides project managers with the centralized
point of management for the Tzunami Deployer licenses. For more information, see
Licensing Service Guide.

If you do have a valid license installed, or the license that you have installed is expired, you
will be prompted to install a new license when you run Tzunami Deployer for SharePoint
Migration. To purchase a new license, contact Tzunami Sales Team at sales@tzunami.com.

If an error message appears, contact the Tzunami Support Team at support@tzunami.com.

To evaluate Tzunami Deployer you do not need Tzunami Licensing Service. If you need
Tzunami Deployer evaluation license, please contact Tzunami Support.

CREATING A NEW MIGRATION PROJECT

Tzunami Deployer stores all the information related to a particular project in a Tzunami

Deployer project. The project consists of a file system folder, which contains the Tzunami
Deployer project file (information describing the SharePoint structure and changes that will

be executed on the target).

Begin using Tzunami Deployer by creating a new project.

To create a project:

1.

2.
3.

Figure 2: New Project Window

Enter a name for the project in the Project name field.

In the Project folder field, enter the location where you want Tzunami Deployer to
create the new project folder.

The project folder contains all the definitions that you create in Tzunami Deployer, automatic
backups of the project, as well as logs and reports of the activities that are performed in and
by Tzunami Deployer.

Tzunami Deployer (x64) does not support SharePoint 2001.

Select one or more types of source systems to be migrated in this project

One of Tzunami Deployer’s advantages is its ability to consolidate several source
systems into a single target SharePoint server. The source options that are available
for selection are determined by the license that you installed, as described in the
previous section. Options that are not permitted by your license are not available for
selection. For e.g. SharePoint 2003 is not available in the window above. For more
information about the Tzunami Deployer license, and for support of systems that are
not listed, contact the Tzunami Support Team.

Select a target system for the migration in this project.

Page | 2-7
6. Click OK. Tzunami Deployer creates the new project folder and initializes the project
files in it. The Project window appears. Initially, both parts of the Project window are
empty.

Figure 3: Project Window

The top half of the Project window uses a Windows Explorer style folder tree and details list
to display the structure and content that has been loaded from the source systems. The
bottom half of the Project window uses a similar approach to display the structure and
content of the target SharePoint. The details list in the top and bottom parts of the Project
window show columns of metadata properties and other information for the children items.

The status bar indicates various types of information, such as the currently listed and
selected items and the status and progress of Tzunami Deployer processes. An indicator on
the left of the status bar displays red when Tzunami Deployer is busy or when a dialog is
open and Tzunami Deployer is waiting for user input. This indicator blinks yellow when
Tzunami Deployer is performing a background operation. During a background operation,
the current stage of the operation is also displayed, as well as a progress bar and the
estimated time remaining for the operation to be completed. The indicator is green at all
other times.

CONNECTING AND LOADING SOURCE SERVER

After creating a Tzunami Deployer project, you can load the information that describes the
source system’s hierarchy structure and the metadata properties associated with each item.
A tab appears in the Project window (Figure 3) for each source system type that you
selected in the New Project window (Figure 2). For more information about creating a
project, see Creating a New Migration Project on page 2-7.

The loaded information is only read from the source system and no modifications are made to
the actual source at any time during the migration process.

You can load information into Tzunami Deployer from one or more of the following source
stores:

e File System — Tzunami Deployer can load information directly from your file system.
For more information, see Loading from File System on page 3-11.

e¢ SharePoint Web Front-End server— Tzunami Deployer can load directly from a
source SharePoint 2003/2007/2010/2013 store. For more information, see
Connecting and Loading from Source SharePoint on page 3-14.

¢ Microsoft Office 365 — Tzunami Deployer can load directly from a source Microsoft
Office 365. For more information, see Connecting Microsoft Office 365 on page 3-
16.

¢ Tzunami Deployer Export (TDX) File — For certain source (such as AquaLogic,
Documentum, DocuShare, Exchange, LiveLink, and so on), Tzunami Deployer first
extracts structure and metadata information into a TDX file using Exporter modules,
and then copies the files into a separate directory on your file system (depending on
your export mode). For more information about exporting source data, see Tzunami
Exporter Guide. You can then load this TDX file into your project. For more
information, see Loading from TDX File on page 3-14.

BS Information loaded from a source system captures the contents of that store at the time it is
loaded (or exported, in the case of TDX files). If the source system is modified after being
loaded, these modifications are not reflected in your Tzunami Deployer project. To access the
up-to-date content of the source system, you must reload that system (or recreate the TDX
file, where necessary).

After loading, two numbers appear to the right of each folder name in the source tree, for

example §2 Log (0/22) The second number is the total number of items in that particular
folder and all its subfolders. The first number is the number of items that were deployed to
the target.

All source items are read-only and their icons are displayed with a blue lock (i) overlay.

Loading from File System

Tzunami Deployer can load directly from a file system into one or more root folders
that you can define in the source tree.

o—

You can load HyperWave directly from a File System by using HMI files generated by

HyperWave. HMI files are text files. It contains properties, their values and security

permission for a specific file folder.

4 In order for a .HMI file to relate to a file/folder, the HMI file should:

Be named after the related file/folder.

For Example — The HMI file sample1.doc.hmi relates to sample1.doc and contains its

properties and security permissions.

Have the correct value for the property ‘Type’

For Example — If the property Type is populated with the value ‘Link’, the file has to

be html (or similar) file.

HMI files must start with the following line:
“HyperWave Meta Information/1.1”
Followed by an empty line

To load a source file system:

1. Click us
Or

Right-click in the File System tab and select Add File System Root or Add

(i The Analyze document content checkbox is selected by default and instructs
Tzunami Deployer to scan each file for embedded metadata properties, such as title,
author, and so on. Metadata is retrieved based on IFilters installed on the computer
running Tzunami Deployer.

If the number of source documents in your file system is very large or each file’s
internal metadata does not need to be migrated, deselect this checkbox. When the
Analyze document content checkbox is deselected, the loading process is faster.

4. Click OK. The source begins to load. When the process is complete, the
folder and files loaded by Tzunami Deployer appear at the top of the Project
window and the status bar displays Ready.

Connecting and Loading from Source SharePoint

If you are migrating contents between SharePoint servers, upgrading from
SharePoint 2003 to SharePoint 2007/SharePoint 2010/SharePoint 2013/Office 365
or simply copying your SharePoint content, Tzunami Deployer is an easy to use,
leading tool to migrate your SharePoint data.

To do so, you must first connect and load the source SharePoint as a source in the
Tzunami Deployer project. This process is identical to the process of loading the
target SharePoint information, except that you right-click in the source store area
and then select the Connect to SharePoint option.

To connect and load source SharePoint:
Click “23Connect
Or

Right-click in the Source SharePoint (For example SharePoint 2013) tab and
select Connect to SharePoint.

The Connection Wizard window appears. For more information about
connecting to SharePoint, see Connecting and Loading Target Server on
page 3-15.

Loading from TDX File

If you have purchased a Tzunami Exporter, you can migrate content from additional
sources, such as SharePoint 2001, LiveLink, and various other systems. This is done
with a Tzunami Deployer Export (TDX) file that can then be loaded as a source in
Tzunami Deployer. If you want to migrate from a content source that is not currently
supported, contact the Tzunami Support Team for more information, including the
specifications for the TDX file format, which can then be used in the same manner as
the sources listed in Connecting and Loading Source Server on page 3-11.

ji When running Tzunami Deployer on several machines, you can run an export on one
machine, and load the exported data on another machine. While copying exported
data to another machine, verify that you copy all the exported data, including both
the TDX file and the extracted files directory (typically named FileStore).

When loading TDxX file, Exporters have two modes of operations: Full Export and Lite
Export. When performing a Full Export, documents that are exported are saved to
the file system and uploaded from the file system during the commit stage. When
performing a Lite Export only the structure, metadata, and security information are
exported, without the documents. During the commit stage, Tzunami Deployer
accesses the source system and downloads the documents that are to be uploaded.
For Lite Export, the Tzunami Exporters must be installed on the Deployer machine.

Page | 3-14
To load a TDx file:
1. Right-click in the source area, and select Load <System Name> TDX. The
Load <System Name> exported information window appears.

& If you have just completed an export, the Load <System Name> exported
information window is already displayed and the Location field already contains the
location of the exported data.

[ox] core |

Figure 8: Load <System Name> exported information window

2. Enter a name for the content to be loaded and specify the location of the
TDX file.

3. Click OK. The source content begins to load. When the process is complete,
the folder and files loaded by Tzunami Deployer appear in the top window
and the status bar displays Ready.

CONNECTING AND LOADING TARGET SERVER

In this step, you load the structure information describing the content of the target
SharePoint (2003, 2007, 2010, 2013 or Office 365). Tzunami Deployer loads the SharePoint
structure information, including portal areas, sites, lists, libraries, folders, documents, items,
wiki page, etc. as well as security and metadata information. This information is displayed at
the bottom of the Project window in the Target SharePoint tab.

o—

The target SharePoint is not modified until the committing step. For more information about
committing, see Committing the Migration on page 4-84.

You first connect to the SharePoint server and then specify what information you want to
load into your Tzunami Deployer project. When you load a SharePoint target, you can
choose to load only some of the items and then load additional items at a later stage.

You can also remove the SharePoint information from the Tzunami Deployer project and
load SharePoint again. This is especially useful for loading a different SharePoint server into
the current Tzunami Deployer project, or for reloading SharePoint content.

Page | 3-15

Tzunami

&

Tzunami

Migration Masters

Information loaded from SharePoint captures the SharePoint content at the time it is loaded.
If SharePoint is modified after being loaded, these modifications are not reflected in your
Tzunami Deployer project. Tzunami recommends that you do not modify the SharePoint
content that is currently being processed by Tzunami Deployer. To access the up-to-date
content of the SharePoint store, you can either remove the SharePoint from your Tzunami
Deployer project or refresh a particular location by reloading it. For more information, see
Removing SharePoint on page 3-32 and Reloading SharePoint Items on _ page 3-32,
respectively.

Load the SharePoint target smartly — plan the migration destination and nature to make it
easier for you to choose which sites and lists you want to load in the target SharePoint.
Loading the entire farm into a single project may be a redundant and time consuming
operation. A template project(s) should contain only the destination top site collection loaded
with no lists or sub-sites (un-loaded lists or sub-sites appear grayed-out in Tzunami Deployer
project and you can reload them later).

Connecting Microsoft Office 365

Microsoft Office 365 can be connected and loaded either as a source or target in
Tzunami Deployer. In order to load Microsoft Office 365 as a target, you must first
connect to an Office 365 for which you need a user account with the following
permissions:

e The user must be a member of SharePoint Online Service Administrator,
global administrator or top-level administrator for your organization.

e The user must be a Site Owner or Site Collection Administrator of SharePoint Site
Collection.

To connect and load Office 365
1. Click 3 Connect
Or
Click Data > Target SharePoint 2013 Online> Connect to SharePoint.

Or

Right-click in the Target SharePoint 2013 Online tab and select Connect to
SharePoint. The Office 365 Connection Wizard appears.

2. Click Next. The Connection Wizard progresses to the Access SharePoint
Server screen.

Connecting and Loading SharePoint Server (without
using Remote Service)

SharePoint (2010 and 2013) Server can be loaded as either a source or target in
Tzunami Deployer without Remote Service. In order to load SharePoint Server as a
target, you must first connect to a SharePoint server for which you need a user
account with permissions. For more information of SharePoint Server 2010/2013
Site Collection Permission, see Connecting Microsoft Office 365 on page 3-16.

To connect and load a SharePoint Server 2013 target without Remote Service:
1. Click #3Connect,
Or
Click Data > Target SharePoint 2013 Remote > Connect to SharePoint.

Or

Right-click in the Target SharePoint 2013 Remote tab and select Connect to
SharePoint. The SharePoint 2013 Connection Wizard appears.

2. Click Next. The Connection Wizard progresses to the Access SharePoint

Connecting and Loading SharePoint 2003

SharePoint 2003 can be connected and loaded as either a source or a target in
Tzunami Deployer. In order to load a SharePoint 2003 target, you must first connect
to a SharePoint 2003 server, for which you need a user account with the following
permissions:

e¢ Administrative permissions on the SharePoint front end server (member of
the local Administrators group).

e¢ Administrative permissions on the SharePoint sites.
¢ Read permissions on the SQL Server Configuration Database of both source
and target SharePoint.

¢ Read permissions on the SQL Server Content Databases of source SharePoint
sites.

¢ Read/Write permissions on the SQL Server Content Databases of target
SharePoint sites.

¢ Read rights on the related Active Directory forest (recommended).

e Execute permissions for the SQL Server stored procedure (in case of SQL
Server 2005 only).

e Administrative share  “\\<SharePoint = machine>\c$\Program __ Files\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions” and all subfolders (if not granted to
the Administrators group).

e Remote registry access to “Local Machine\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared
Tools\Web Server Extensions\” and all sub keys (if not granted to the
Administrators group).

Tzunami Deployer cannot remotely access SPS2003/WSS2.0 servers when the
backend database of SharePoint is built on the WMSDE edition of SQL Server. In this
case Tzunami Deployer must be installed locally on the SharePoint machine.

Missing DNS settings may hinder Tzunami Deployer’s ability to access SharePoint
front end servers, SQL servers, or domain servers. In such case, copy the DNS servers’
definitions from the SharePoint servers. For more information about connecting to
SharePoint, see Connecting and Loading Target Server on page 3-15.

Reloading SharePoint Items

If you choose not to read all the sites or lists in the SharePoint Structure screen of
the SharePoint Connection Wizard (Figure 17), they appear in the SharePoint tree,
grayed out and unavailable. Similarly, if changes are made to SharePoint after it is
loaded into Tzunami Deployer, those changes are not reflected in your Tzunami
Deployer project. In both cases, you can refresh the SharePoint information in the
Tzunami Deployer project by reloading selected items.

& This option is disabled if modifications are made to the SharePoint location.

To reload SharePoint items:

1. In the Target SharePoint tab, right-click the desired item and select Reload
Item. The Load SharePoint Items window appears.

2. Select which items you wish to reload and whether to load all document
versions, according to the information in Table 3.

3. Click OK. A Results window appears, displaying the load progress. The items
are reloaded into your project window.

Removing SharePoint Project

You can load a different SharePoint server into the current Tzunami Deployer project
or you can reload SharePoint content in all the virtual servers by removing the
SharePoint information from the Tzunami Deployer project and loading a new
SharePoint target.

To remove a SharePoint target:

e Right-click in the Target SharePoint tab and select Remove SharePoint from
Project. All target SharePoint information is removed from the project.

i
8 The project is automatically saved after the SharePoint is removed.

Page | 3-32
BEST PRACTICE

e Use a template project: Create one project as a template, preferably with the
SharePoint target loaded. Clone this project (using the Save As option) multiple
times — in accordance to the data exported in the export phase.

¢ Be organized: Verify that your project files are saved under a well-organized file
system hierarchy.

¢ Prepare a project for Deploying:

¢ Open one of the projects you have created.

e Load the source data into that project. Load the structure and then reload
desired content within it.

¢ Reload the target destination site/sub-site/list which may not be fully loaded
(if you loaded it only partially). If there are many documents in a target list,
for example, it may be unnecessary to load all the existing documents when
reloading that list. However, choosing not to load this could prevent
Tzunami Deployer from identifying duplicate file names.

¢ Document versions for target need not be loaded.

¢ Work on multiple projects in parallel. You can run 3 instances of Deployer on
one front end server (assuming 4GB RAM, 2 GHz Xeon processor server
configuration). However it is recommended that the instances be increased
or decreased based on server load.

4 MODELING, DEPLOYING AND COMMITTING
DEPLOYER PROJECT

This chapter explains how to model target SharePoint and deploy the source content. This
chapter contains the following topics:

e¢ Modeling SharePoint Target

¢ Deploying Source Data for Migration

¢ Committing the Migration

Page | 4-34

Migration Masters
MODELING SHAREPOINT TARGETS

Tzunami Deployer enables you to model your target SharePoint, into which the source
content will eventually be migrated. You can model:

e Structure — Create or modify site collections, sites, portal areas (SPS2003 only),
libraries, lists and folders. For more information, see Modeling SharePoint Structure
on page 4-35.

e¢ Metadata — Design the property sets and properties that comprise the columns of
the target SharePoint lists. For more information, see Modeling SharePoint
Metadata Service on page 4-41.

e Security and Permissions — Create or modify groups and permissions levels, add
users and assign permissions. For more information, see Viewing Security
Information on page 4-47.

If you are satisfied with your existing target SharePoint structure and do not wish to make
any modifications to it, you can skip this section and proceed to the deploying step. For
more information about deploying, see Deploying Source Data for Migration on page 4-59.

After loading a target SharePoint, you can model your target SharePoint.

Modeling a SharePoint target does not actually modify your server. All changes are made in
your Tzunami Deployer project and are only applied to the target SharePoint when you
commit them. For more information about committing, see Committing the Migration on
page 4-84.

Modeling SharePoint Structure

Tzunami Deployer enables you to use its simple and intuitive interface to create,
delete, or modify items in the target SharePoint structure. SharePoint
2007/2010/2013 or Office 365 supports creating folders under lists. SharePoint 2003
only supports creating folders under libraries. Tzunami Deployer also enables you to
edit the properties of existing SharePoint items. For more information, see Editing
Properties of SharePoint Item on page 4-38. You can right-click the following items
and select an action from the context sensitive menu:

e = Sites

e Portal Areas

e — Lists
e Folders
e = Items

Tan SS

Migration Masters
Tzunam

Migration Masters

& You can also rename an item by selecting it and pressing F2. SharePoint imposes
some character and length limitations on item names. For more information, see
Folder and File Naming Considerations on page | or refer to your SharePoint
documentation. Tzunami Deployer may rename folders or documents by replacing

invalid characters with an underscore (_).

These procedures are similar to the procedures used in the native SharePoint
environment. Any SharePoint item can be deleted, except for virtual servers and
some built-in lists.

The icons of newly created items in Tzunami Deployer are displayed with a star (=)
overlay. Similarly, the icons of modified items in Tzunami Deployer are displayed
with a pencil (#) overlay. The overlays signify that the particular item exists or is
modified in the Tzunami Deployer project only, and not in SharePoint. For example:

fa- Existing unmodified document library.
- Existing modified document library.
ree New document library.
The overlays are removed after the changes are committed.

Creating a New Site

Tzunami Deployer allows you to create new sites on the target SharePoint Structure.
New site can be added as a site collection, if created under the virtual server or a
web application, or as a sub-site, if created under another site, from the templates
(like Blogs, My Sites, Team Sites, Meeting Workspaces etc.) and according to the
location you selected in the target SharePoint.

To create a SharePoint site in Tzunami Deployer:

1. Right-click the location in the target SharePoint in which to create the new
site and select New > Site. The New WSS Site window appears.

from their parent, for they do not have a parent). When you create a sub-site, the
opposite is true.

2. Enter information describing the URL. A SharePoint site URL is comprised of
the following:

e Server address — The server URL, such as http://moss.tzunami.net.
This value can also be an IP address.

¢ Managed path — Typically sites/ or personal/. Additional
managed paths can be configured in SharePoint.

e Hierarchy of site group and parent sites — Relevant for sub-sites
only.

e Site name — For a site collection, enter a site name and select the
managed path from the drop-down list. For any other site, enter the
site name.

3. Enter a Title and Description to be used for the new SharePoint site.

4. Select the Site Template to be used. When you select a template, a short
description is displayed below it.

o—

For a site collection, enter the owner account.

For sub-sites, select whether the site should use unique permissions. If you do not
select Use unique permissions, the site inherits the permissions of its parent site.

5. Click OK.

The new SharePoint site is added to the target SharePoint tree. The
configuration of the new site is determined by the SharePoint site template
you selected.

Editing Properties of SharePoint Item
Different types of items have different properties and settings that can be edited, as
follows:

Page | 4-38

Tzunami

Migration Masters
e Sites that are created in Tzunami Deployer and have not yet been
committed to the target SharePoint can be edited using the Edit Site option.
Properties of all sites can be viewed using the Properties window. The URL,
language, and template of the site cannot be edited.

e Lists, folders, files, and list items can be edited using the Properties window.

& The Properties window can remain open while you work in the Project window. It
reflects the properties of the currently selected item.

Several items can be simultaneously edited using the Properties window. For more
information about the Properties window, see Viewing Item Properties on page 4-56.

You can edit the properties of new sites till they are committed to the target
SharePoint. However, you cannot edit the properties of sites that already exist in
SharePoint. Such existing sites can only be viewed in the Properties window.

To edit properties of a new site:

1. Right-click a new site in the target SharePoint tree and select Edit Site. The
New WSS Site window appears (Figure 24) with the non-editable fields
disabled.

2. Modify all the enabled properties and click OK.

The site’s properties are edited.

Find and Replace File Names
The Find and Replace window is used to make naming corrections to files and
folders within Document Libraries.

To correct file and folder names within Document Libraries:

1. Right-click a Document Library in the target SharePoint tree and select Find
& Replace.

The Find and Replace window is displayed.

The Select Problematic Items is very useful if you have just deployed content but have
yet to commit it, and would like to prevent illegal naming, blocked extensions and long
URLs in SharePoint. For example, replacing “Business Intelligence” with “BI” is a good
solution for handling long URLs.

Modeling SharePoint Metadata Service

Documents and data items are associated with metadata properties (also referred to
as fields or attributes) such as creation date, author, title, keywords, status, and so
on.

In SharePoint, the metadata is managed via lists and libraries. Each list or library has
its own property set — the collection of properties that is specific to the container.

The Metadata Editor provides you with a centralized authoring environment in
which to define the columns of all lists and libraries in the entire target store. Using
the Metadata Editor you can create new property sets, duplicate property sets,
create new properties, and copy them from one property set to another.

To view the Metadata Editor:
1. Select View > Metadata Editor.
Or
Click =
Or
Press F9.

The Metadata Editor window appears. The top half of the window displays
the property sets of the selected source system. The bottom half displays
the property sets of the target SharePoint store.

The Metadata Editor window displays the property sets on the left and the
properties of the currently selected property set on the right.

While the cursor hovers over a property set, a hint appears displaying the number of
containers that are using the property set.

Assigning Property Sets

Property sets have underlying types that must match the list to which you assign
them, so that a document library property set can only be assigned to a document
library and not to a different library (For e.g. an image library) or to a different type
of list. A property set cannot be used on more than one list or library. This section is
relevant to property sets that are not in use (new or duplicated).

To assign a property set to a list:

1. Drag and drop a property set from the Metadata Editor onto a library or list
in the Project window.

Or

Right-click the property set and select ‘Assign To...’. The Target Items
window appears.

7 While you drag a property set to a valid location, the cursor changes to a link. If the
target location is not valid, either because it is already assigned with the same
property set, or because it is of a different type than the property set underlying
type, the cursor changes to a ‘not allowed’ symbol (©).

Created property set can be assigned to list or library. For more information about
Creating Property Sets on page 4-43 and Creating and Editing Properties on page 4-
43.

Modeling SharePoint Security and Permissions

SharePoint 2007, SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2013 and Office 365 Security
Each site collection in SharePoint 2007, SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2013 and Office
365 has its own list of users and groups. Once you grant certain user permissions on
content or sub content of the site collection, the user is added to the site user list.
Also, new groups that are created are added as site collection groups.

In SharePoint 2007, SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2013 and Office 365 content can
be secured at all hierarchy levels: site, list, library, folder, or item. Each user is
granted permission for the specific content, either directly or by being a member of
a site group which has permissions for that content.

Once you create sub content, the default security settings to this sub-content are
inherited from the parent content. Using the SharePoint user interface, you can
change these default settings and assign unique permissions to the sub-content.

SharePoint 2007, SharePoint 2010, SharePoint 2013 and Office 365 have used the
concept of permission-levels, which are permission sets. Each user or group can be
assigned with one or more permission-levels. Permission-levels are managed in sites
and can be inherited from a parent site.

SharePoint 2003 Security

In SharePoint 2003, site group is used as a role. This means that if you wish to grant
a user certain permissions, you add that user as a member of a site group that has
those permissions. Each site that breaks inheritance has its own set of groups.

Page | 4-50
Tzunami

Migration Masters

In SharePoint 2003, content can be secured only at the site, list, or library level. A

user could be granted site permissions only by being a member of one of the site

groups. Also, a user can get explicit permissions on a list or library.

o—

Active Directory groups are represented as SharePoint users.

A SharePoint group cannot contain another SharePoint group. Each group represents
a collection of SharePoint users.

Tzunami Deployer enables you to perform the following security and permissions

customizations:

Create groups

Assign permissions to users
Modify or delete groups

DEPLOYING SOURCE DATA FOR MIGRATION

The deployment stage specifies which source folders, files, and items are to be migrated to
which SharePoint site collections, sites, lists, and folders on the target SharePoint server.
Similar to the modeling stage, Tzunami Deployer does not immediately migrate the source
items to the SharePoint server during deployment, but only stores the migration instructions
in the current Tzunami Deployer project. The Tzunami Deployer content migration changes
are only applied to the target SharePoint server in the committing stage. For more
information about committing, see Committing the Migration on page 4-84.

In the modeling stage, you can define the SharePoint structure into which you can deploy
the source folders and files. If you wish, you can design and define the entire model of the
SharePoint structure and only then deploy your first folders and files. Alternatively, you can
iteratively design parts of the SharePoint structure, deploy the items into those parts and
then go back and repeat this process as many times as required.

In some cases, not all source items are to be migrated. For example, executable files such as
EXE and DLL are usually not stored in SharePoint. In other cases, the target location for items
is determined by their metadata properties. For example, you may want items created in the
year 2001 to be placed in a corresponding folder in SharePoint. In both cases, you can filter
the source so that only relevant items will be affected by the current deployment operation.
For more information, see Filtering Source Items on page 4-81.

After completing the deployment stage, the target items appear with an upload overlay (‘#).
To remove the item assignment, find the location in which the item is deployed (in the
target SharePoint) and delete it. For information about finding deployment locations, see
Managing the Deployment Process on page 4-80.

The following steps describe how to deploy source items to a target SharePoint:

Tzunami

Migration Masters

Page | 4-59
Tzunami

Migration Masters

Select the actual items to be deployed from the source to the target SharePoint. For
more information, see Deploying Selected Source Items to a Target SharePoint
Locations on page 4-60.

Specify the various deployment options, related to structure, files, and security,
using the Deploy Wizard. For more information, see Defining Deployment Options
on page 4-61.

Keep track of the deployment process to ensure that you have deployed all the
items that are required. For more information, see Managing the Deployment
Process on page 4-80.

SharePoint imposes some character and length limitations on item names. For more
information, see Folder and File Naming Considerations on page | or refer to your SharePoint

documentation. Tzunami Deployer may rename folders or documents by replacing invalid
characters with an underscore (_).

Deploying Selected Source Items to a Target SharePoint
Locations

When you select to deploy a source item to a target SharePoint item, some items
may not be deployed for the following reasons:

¢ The file extension appears in the blocked extensions list, as defined by the
SharePoint administrator (For Example: .exe, .bat, .mdb, and so on). You
can ignore this warning and deploy the items. However, the commit will fail
unless the items are renamed or the SharePoint server is modified to accept
the files.

¢ The item has already been deployed into SharePoint. Tzunami Deployer
does not allow the same item to be deployed more than once into
SharePoint.

To select the source items and target locations:

1. Inthe top half of the Project window, select the source files or folders to be
deployed.

2. Drag the selected items to the target location in the SharePoint, in the
bottom half of the Project window.

Or

Right-click the selected items in the source store and select Deploy to. The
Target items window appears displaying the target SharePoint store.

Page | 4-60
Tzunami

Migration Masters

3. Select the target location and click OK.

P
@

The Deploy Wizard appears (Figure 49).

Tzunami recommends that you to drag and drop selected items. By this stage, you
should already know exactly what you are dragging, where you are dragging to, as
what (site, list, or document), and which properties you want to add.

Tzunami Deployer may inform you that some items will not be deployed. You can
display these items by clicking Yes.

Defining Deployment Options

After selecting the source items and target location for deployment, the next step is

to define the behavior of the deployment. This is done using the Deploy wizard,

which guides you through the following:

Specify how Tzunami Deployer handles item versions, duplicate names, and
lists. For more information, see Defining Global Settings on page 4-63.
Specify whether source folders are created in the target SharePoint as sites,
lists, or folders, and how subfolders and content items be handled. For more
information, see Defining the Deployment Structure on page 4-65.

Map source users and groups to the appropriate corresponding users and
groups used in the target SharePoint. For more information, see Mapping
Security Information on page 4-75.

Map source security permissions and roles to the appropriate SharePoint
roles / permission-levels. For more information, see Mapping Security
Information on page 4-75.

Map source metadata properties to the appropriate columns in the target
SharePoint. For more information, see Mapping Properties on page 4-67.

Map source item property values to the appropriate property values in the
target SharePoint. For more information, see Mapping Property Values on
page 4-72.

For example:

e¢ When deploying into a folder or a list, you can only create sub-folders.

e When deploying into a site, you can create sub-sites or lists.

The configuration that you set for any item overrides the configuration of its
sub-items. For e.g. when deploying into a site, if you deploy a folder as a

2. Click Next. If Security is deployed, the Deploy wizard displays the Map
source users and groups screen (Figure 59). If Security is not deployed, the
Deploy wizard displays the Property Mapping screen (Figure 54). For more
information, see Mapping Properties on page 4-67.

Mapping Properties

Items are associated with metadata properties (sometimes referred to as fields or
attributes), such as creation date, last modification date, author, title, keywords,

status, and so on.

When the source property set (sometimes referred to as category or profile) does
not match the target SharePoint property set (the columns in the target list or
folder), Tzunami Deployer requests information regarding the mapping of source
properties to target properties. The Property Mapping screen appears, as shown

below. Properties with the same name and matching types are automatically
matched and appear in the Mapped Properties area, as well as previously mapped
properties.

Tzunami Deployer has an ability to add Content Types (that already exists on the
Target Site Collection) to the lists/libraries during deployment. For more
information, see Adding Content Type on page 4-69.

If any source properties cannot be matched to any target property, a yellow
notification bar at the top of the screen indicates that the target has fewer
properties than the source. This may indicate that you might lose data, since source
information is not deployed to target SharePoint columns. You can click the link in
the notification bar to automatically add properties to your target SharePoint list.
For more information, see Automatically Adding Properties on page 4-71.
Alternatively, you can manually add the missing columns before starting the
deployment process. For more information, see Modeling SharePoint Metadata
Service on page 4-41.

If the source items use several different property sets, For e.g. documents with
different profiles, or when deploying to several targets with different property sets
or lists of different types, this step is repeated for each pair of source and target
property sets.

Clicking Import/Export enables you to create a property mapping XML file, according
to your current mappings, or load a different property mapping XML file. You can
generate your own mappings (using Excel, or any other tool that generates XML files)
and import the XML file. For more information about property mapping XML files,
see Sample Property Mapping XML File on page 5-116.

Click Next. The Deploy wizard displays the Value Mapping screen (Figure

If you map properties of different types to each other (For e.g. a text property to a
numeric property), a warning message is displayed. Clicking Yes instructs Tzunami
Deployer to convert the values. If Tzunami Deployer fails, it assigns an empty value to
the target property. Clicking No returns you to the Property Mapping screen, in
which you must change the mapping.

window.

Mapping Security Information

The first page of the Deploy Wizard contains the Deploy Security checkbox.
Selecting this checkbox enables you to also deploy the source security settings for
your deployed containers and items.

If you select the Deploy Security checkbox, the following screens are added to the
wizard:

¢ Groups mapping — Mapping of source groups to target groups as containers
of users.

e Entities mapping — The concrete user mapping.

¢ Roles Mapping — Mapping of source roles (permissions sets) to target roles.

In the following example we review a deployment from LiveLink to MOSS.

Assuming we would like to deploy the following hierarchy as a Document Library
into MOSS:

David’s permissions Ron’s Test Group’s
permissions permissions
© Documents See, modify, add See, modify, See, modify, add
delete, add
& FileA See, modify See, modify, See
delete
S File B See, modify See, modify, See
delete
© Sub Folder See, modify, delete, add, See, modify, See
modify permissions delete, add
S& File 1 See, modify, delete, See, modify, See
modify permissions delete

Tzunami Deployer uses the concept of security roles, each representing a set of
permissions. If the source system supports this concept, the roles are read from the
system. Otherwise, Tzunami Deployer generates its own roles. You can add, remove
and modify the roles used.

David’s set of permissions qualify him the role of Contributor on the Documents
folder and its content, but qualifies as an Administrator on Sub Folder and its child
item. Ron’s role is Web Designer on all the hierarchy and Test Group has the role of
Reader on all content except for Documents, in which he is a Contributor.

Page | 4-75
Groups Mapping

Map Source Groups

Figure 59: Group Mapping screen

The screen consists of three lists:

e Source groups — The source groups that are relevant to the items deployed.

¢ Target groups — The target groups that are relevant to the site into which
we deploy.

¢ Mapped - Pairs consist of source groups and target groups that are already
mapped.

In this step you can map a source group either to an existing site group, or to create
a new site group bearing the same name.

In our example, we have only one source group (Test Group), and in the target we
have the three default site groups (Members, Owners, and Visitors) and one user-
created group named Target Group. We will map Test Group to Target Group. This
means the members of Test Group will be added as members of the Target Group.

& If the source is File System, this step is absent, since File System groups are treated
as Active Directory groups, which can be mapped to SharePoint users (see Entities
Mapping on page 4-77).

This screen also consists of three lists:

e Source users & groups — The source users and groups that are relevant to
the specific items deployed. Included are users belonging to the groups.

¢ Target users & groups — All the local and domain users in the target. This
means that also users that are not relevant to the target site are included (if
you map to these users, they will be added to the target site).

¢ Mapped - Pairs consist of source user or group and target user or group
each, that were already mapped.

In this step you can map each source user or group to a target user or group.

Mapping a source entity to a target entity means that the target entity will receive
the same permissions that the source entity has. These permissions will be assigned
based on the role mapping step (see Role Mapping on page 4-77). Also, when
Tzunami Deployer performs the group mapping, group membership is migrated
based on the entities mapping.

& You can use the Filter field in order to drill down to a specific name.

Tzunami Deployer suggests some of the mappings based on the user names. Also
Tzunami Deployer suggests the mapping of groups based on our mapping on the

Figure 61: Role Mapping screen

This screen contains three lists:

e Source roles — The source roles (each role is a permissions set).

¢ Target users & groups — Target roles. You can select more than one target

role.

¢ Mapped — Pairs consist of a source role and its mapped target role(s).

Roles, as mentioned earlier, are sets of permissions. In this step you map a source
role to a target role. This means that target entities that were mapped to a source
entity with a certain role will be assigned with the corresponding role that will be

mapped in this screen.

A sensible mapping would be: Administrator > Full Control, Contributor >
Contribute, Reader > Read, Web Designer > Design.

o—

You can check more than one target role.

When migrating from WSS2.0/SPS2003, Site groups are handled as both groups
(containers of users), and roles (sets of permissions). This means that Site groups will
appear in both the Groups mapping and the Roles mapping steps.

Following our example, the outcome of our security mapping will be:

David’s role Ron’srole Test Group’s role

To find problematic items:

e Select View > Find > Find Problems.

Tzunami Deployer scans the hierarchy in the target system for problematic
items. If there are no problematic items, a message is shown. If Tzunami
Deployer encounters problematic items, the Problematic Items window
appears (Figure 62).

& The window updates itself as you modify items to handle their problems.
You can double-click (or click Go To) on an item to navigate to it directly.

Click Copy to clipboard and Export to retrieve the list of problematic items.

The following problems are checked:

e Name contains invalid character.
¢ Name and URL are too long

¢ Blocked extensions

e Files are too large

e Properties values are legal (Hyperlinks start with a protocol
schema, required properties have values, required properties do not
have a default value).

Managing the Deployment Process

This section describes a variety of options that enable you to keep track of the
deployment process. For e.g., you can determine which source items are deployed
to which target locations:

e Item Counters - Items in the container versus the number of items
deployed. For example, the following shows that only one item of the 25 in
this hierarchy is deployed:

le Files} (1/25)

The first number is the number of files and items deployed, but not yet
committed to the target SharePoint. The second number is the total number
of files and items in that particular location and all its nested hierarchy. In
the source system, this enables you to verify that all files intended for
migration were indeed deployed. In the target SharePoint system, this
indicates how many items currently in the specific location were deployed
but were not yet committed to SharePoint.

e Icon Overlays — Each item or folder can only be deployed once. After
deployment, the icons of both source and target items appear with an

upload overlay (@). For e.g. rey

If you try to redeploy an item that is already deployed, a message is
displayed. You can remove a deployed item by finding the location to which
the item is deployed (in the target SharePoint) and delete it.

¢ Find Source/Target Tool — You can find the correlation between items in the
source and their new location in the target:

* Select a source item and click 2? Find Source/Target to find the
deployed target item.

e Select a target item and click 29 Find Source/Target to find the
deployed source item.

¢ Deployed To / Deployed From Column — The source includes a Deployed To
column that specifies the address of new item in the target SharePoint. The
target SharePoint includes a Deployed From column that specifies the
address of the source item that was deployed.

e Find Problems — You can instruct Tzunami Deployer to search for known
problems (such as long URLs, which is a SharePoint limitation, blocked
extensions, and so on) by selecting View > Find > Find Problems. This option
can only be performed before the committing stage, on uncommitted items.

¢ Deployment Report — Before committing your changes, you can view a
report of the deployed items. Tzunami recommends that you review the
Deployment Report carefully and search for any warnings. The Deployment
Report is stored in the following directory:
<Project Folder>\Reports\DeployReport.<Date>.<Time>.xml.

e Filtering Source Items — Tzunami Deployer enables you to filter the items
that appear in the source system. For more information, see Filtering Source
Items on page 4-81.

Filtering Source Items

When you apply a filter to a folder, the filter is automatically applied to all sub-
folders. You can set a different filter for a sub-folder or disable filtering for it
altogether by editing the sub-folder’s filter settings.

To filter the source store list:

full filter expression.
You can only add one condition per property.

You can edit a condition for a property by selecting the property and modifying the
condition type or it’s currently assigned values and clicking Add Condition.

You can remove a condition from a property or all the conditions from all the
properties by clicking Clear Condition or Clear All, respectively.

Click Import/Export Button. Export button can be pressed to dump added
filter condition as an XML file. Likewise, Import button can be pressed to
import the saved filter conditions accordingly.

Best Practice for deploying source

Drag and drop: Deploy selected items from the source to a pre-determined
location in the target. At this stage of the Deployment, you should already
be aware of what you’re dragging (site, list, etc.) and which properties you
want to add accordingly.

Mass Deploy: Repeat the “Drag and Drop” phase for as many projects as
you like. Keep in mind that using more than one person to conduct the
migration can help you move through the different phases simultaneously
and thereby at a quicker pace.

Make sure not to deploy the same site collection using two different
projects that are destined to run simultaneously, as this could cause
inconsistency issues.

Review the Deploy Reports for any warnings

Check for problems before commit: Before committing your project to
SharePoint, use the “find problems” option from the Deployer menu (Ctrl
+P) in order to identify any issues that may occur as a result of SharePoint
limitations, such as long URLs, or blocked extensions.

SharePoint Limitations: Keep in mind SharePoint column limitations while
adding missing properties.

Multiple Deployment: Simulate multiple deployments for a source type till
you find the one that suits your needs best. Use the same deployment
pattern for that item type in future.

Page | 4-83
COMMITTING THE MIGRATION

The committing stage executes your target SharePoint customizations and migrates your
source items to your target SharePoint. You can perform the committing stage immediately
after deployment or you can schedule it for a later date. For more information, see Schedule
Commit on page 4-86 and Batch Mode Commit on page 4-88.

The committing process first applies the model that was designed in Modeling SharePoint
Targets on page 4-35. This ensures that the sites, libraries, lists, and folders are created in
the target SharePoint and that their metadata is set, so that they are ready for the migration
of items into them, according to the deployment scheme you built in Deploying Source Data
for Migration on page 4-59.

The actual content migration physically copies the source items (For e.g. Microsoft Office
documents) to the target library, list, or folder on the SharePoint site, while updating their
metadata properties according to the Tzunami Deployer project definitions.

You can estimate how much time the committing stage requires with the following
calculation:

(xxY)
75 \ = anticipated committing time.

(NxZ)
Where:
X — The total number of documents to commit.

Y— The average committing rate for one Tzunami Deployer instance. This rate can be
determined by committing a project and dividing the number of documents by the
amount of hours taken to complete committing.

Z— The number of servers (that meet the required specifications) available on which to
run Tzunami Deployer.

N— The number of Tzunami Deployer instances planned to run on each server.

Tzunami

Migration Masters

P

While your projects are in the committing stage, create and work on additional projects to save time.
When one project finishes the committing stage, you can immediately begin committing another.

You can run multiple Tzunami Deployer projects on a single server. Keep in mind that the number of
Tzunami Deployer projects running simultaneously on one machine and the total number of running
projects depends on your hardware, network connections, and the SharePoint environment
maintenance and response time. This maintenance and response time depends on the amount of
free memory on the machines running Tzunami Deployer, hardware, available CPU, network
connectivity to SharePoint, DB indices on the SharePoint SQL server, and so on.

Avoid making additional changes directly to your target SharePoint during the committing stage.

Page | 4-84
After the committing stage is complete, the numbers on the left of the item counters in both
the source and target trees are set to zero and the New, Modified, and Deployed overlays
are removed from all icons.

Committing Now

Best Practice for Committing a Deployer Project

Check for problems before commit

Start committing the projects: While these projects are committing, begin
creating as many new Deployer projects as you can.

Run several Deployer instances on one server: The number of Deployer
projects running simultaneously on one machine and the total number of
projects which can run simultaneously depend on your hardware, network
connection and SharePoint environment maintenance and response time
(free memory on the machines running Deployer, HD availability, CPU,
network connectivity to the SharePoint farm, DB indices on the SharePoint
SQL server, etc.).

Don’t waste time: You can immediately commit another project as soon as
the previous project finishes committing. You also have the option to
schedule a commit in the future through the use of the Microsoft Windows
Task Scheduler combined with Deployer’s command line capabilities. Keep
in mind SharePoint column limitations while adding missing properties.

Avoid performing changes to the SharePoint outside of Deployer during
the commit phase.

In order to produce a rough estimation on the duration of the Commit
Phase, verify the following environment-dependent variables:

eX: Total number of documents to commit

e Y: Average commit rate for one Deployer instance. Test this once
with one project committing M documents for H hours and just doa
simple calculation of M/H.

e¢  Z:Number of servers available to run Deployer

Page | 4-90
e N: Number of Deployer instances designated to run on each server.

& It is not recommended to run more than 3 Deployer instances on a single server.

Rough time estimation for the duration of the commit process can be
el , (XxY)
calculating using these parameters:
(Nx Z)

e Schedule Commit: With Scheduled Commit, you can schedule Tzunami
Deployer to commit a project at a time that is most convenient for you.

e Identify Issues: During commit, or any other phase of the migration project,
identify any problems that may arise. Save the export/deploy/commit
reports and logs which contain any warnings or errors. Notify the Tzunami
Support Team about these issues.

5 CONFIGURING TZUNAMI DEPLOYER
ADVANCE FEATURES

This chapter describes how to configure Tzunami Deployer settings and covers the following
topics:
e Rule Engine

¢ Tzunami Deployer Options

=~
Page | 5-92
Tzunam “

Migration Masters
RULE ENGINE

Deployer Rule Engine is a powerful Deployer component that enables you to automate large
parts of the deployment process by creating flowcharts of If-Then statements in a rules
editor.

A Rule consists of a set of conditions (logical IFs) and Actions (logical THENs). If all conditions
are fully met, then the Actions are executed. A Rule Set is a set of rules that define
deployment options for a specific Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system.

The Deployer Rule Engine is intended for power users, System Integrators, and Tzunami
Deployer specialists. It provides you with a high degree of freedom in regard to the business
logic you can create.

The order of the Rules in a Rule Set is important. The Rule Engine processes each container
item in the deployed item, evaluating the Rules one after the other against each item. If
even one Condition is not met, the Rule is ignored, and the Rule Engine proceeds to the next
Rule. If all Conditions are met, the Actions are performed, and the Rule Engine continues
handling the next item. No other rule is evaluated for that item. As a result, even if two Rules
are valid for a certain item, only the first Rule is evaluated and performed.

The Rule Sets Editor contains several built-in default Rule Sets that define some common
deployment logic schemas. You can customize these default Rule Sets to suit your specific
deployment needs.

Configuring Rule Engine

You can choose whether to involve the Rule Engine in the deployment process.
Tzunami recommends that you start working with Tzunami Deployer without the
Rule Engine. After you are familiar with Tzunami Deployer’s behavior and features,
you can create a new Rule Set and enable the Rule Engine to generate suggestions.

To set the Rule Engine interaction level

1. Select Tools > Options. The Options window appears.
2. Click Rule Engine.

3. Select one of the following levels of interaction from Rule Engine Settings:

¢ Don’t use Rule Engine - The Rule Engine does not take part in the
deployment process.

e Rule Engine provides options — The Rule Engine generates
suggestions for the deployment process. The deployment wizard is
displayed to the user to validate and acknowledge the options.

4. Click OK.

The Rule Engine interaction level is set.

Rule Sets Editor

You can create multiple Rule Sets for each ECM system. However, at any given time,
only one Rule Set can be used during the deployment process. For more information
about “Rule Set” see Rule Engine on page 5-133.

If you define contradicting Conditions in a Rule, the Rule will never be executed,
because there will never be a case when all Conditions are met.

You can define a Rule with no conditions. This rule will apply to all items. However,
note that only this rule will be executed. This rule is useful with the Execute the
following Rules <Rules> action. For more information, see Execute the following

Where;

DisplayName is the Properties Display name.
Name is the SharePoint internal name.

PropertyType can be one of the following: DateTime, ModStat,
User, Choice, and Text.

Sample Value Mapping XML File

Note that the sample mapping file includes references to two external XML files that
contain value mappings (highlighted in the sample): Status and Priority. The Status
value mapping file for this example is:

<ValueMapping>

<Pair Source=“Issue” Target=“Waiting on someone else” />

<Pair Source=“Completed” Target=“Completed” />

<Pair Source=™“{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57D}”
Target=“Not Started” />

<Pair Source=™“{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57C}”
Target=“ { D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57A}” />
</ValueMapping>

Where value mapping provides a few “placeholder” values:
{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57C} — Empty Source.
{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57D} — Default Source.
{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57A} — Target Map to Empty.
{D3A98B62-323C-4130-AA18-2CA791C9E57B} — Target Map to Keep Original.

These values match the values available to users in the Value Mapping step of the
deployment wizard.

Remarks

You can create the mapping file manually, but it is recommended to export a
property mapping during a regular deployment, and use the exported mapping. For
more information, see Importing and Exporting Users on page 4-55.

help of the following two options:

i. Leave values as is (containing source item id): If you
select this option, the choice value in target appears
as:

“Item id;* Item Value”, where “Item id” is the lookup
id and “Item Value” is the lookup value.

this option the choice value in target appears as:

“Item Value”, which is the lookup value.

FOLDER AND FILE NAMING CONSIDERATIONS

To ensure the smooth management of a SharePoint migration project, you should ensure that your
folder and file names and pathnames conform to the following guidelines and other constraints.

FOLDER PATH AND FULLY QUALIFIED FILE NAME LENGTHS

A fully qualified file name consists of two parts:

1. File name including the file base name and file extension.
2. Folder path for the fully qualified file name.

The filename is the last component of a fully qualified file name. The folder path for a fully qualified
file name starts with the drive letter and includes everything up to the filename and the last folder
character (such as \ or /).

Restrictions

Microsoft Windows:

The fully qualified file name can have a maximum length of 260 characters.

The maximum length of a folder path portion of a fully qualified file name is 248 characters.
Microsoft SharePoint:

The fully qualified file name can have a maximum length of 255 characters in Windows.

Normally, it is not possible to create folder paths and fully qualified file names that are too
long when using Windows Explorer or a Windows application. However, it is possible under

the following scenarios:

A subfolder one or more levels below the root of the file system is shared as a UNC file share.
In this case, it is possible to create an entire new folder hierarchy under the root of the file
share that can store files using fully qualified file name that are a further 260 characters long.

Similarly, the subset command can be used to anchor a drive letter at a subfolder one or more
levels below the root of the file system.

Using Unicode fully qualified file names prefixed with the letters: \\?\. When this approach is
used, fully qualified path names can be 32,000 characters in length.

NAMING CONSIDERATIONS

Files

The following characters are not supported in Windows SharePoint Services:

/\:*2""<>|#{}%&~ or tab characters and multiple periods.

Installation

Where do | get the install software for the Tzunami Deployer Remote Service?

Tzunami Deployer Remote Service is a component needed in order to run Tzunami
Deployer on non-SharePoint machines. This component is not available during the Tzunami
Deployer evaluation phase (in which the Tzunami Deployer installation must be on the
SharePoint server). Upon purchasing the product, all relevant links for download are
supplied. If you have any more questions about this subject, please contact the Tzunami

Support Team at support@tzunami.com.

Does Tzunami Deployer support running migration operations without having to install
any components on the SharePoint servers?

When performing a migration to SharePoint 2003, there are no components that require
installation on the SharePoint server.

When migrating to SharePoint 2007/ SharePoint 2010/ SharePoint 2013, the current
version of Tzunami Deployer requires a Windows service component, Tzunami Remote
Service and Tzunami Link Resolver Service to be installed on the SharePoint server.

When migrating to Office 365 or SharePoint Server 2010 (without using remote service),
the current version of Tzunami Deployer requires Windows service components, Tzunami
Sandbox Solution. For more information, see the Tzunami Deployer Installation Guide.

Is Tzunami Deployer a Windows or a web based application?

Tzunami Deployer is a Windows-based application with a Windows service component
running on the SharePoint server (for migration to SharePoint 2007/ SharePoint 2010/
Office 365/ SharePoint 2023 only).

Migration Masters

Permissions

What access rights does Tzunami Deployer require on the source environment?

This varies from system to system. Generally, a user with full read permissions is required
for the source system. A user that can access the data through the regular system
interface should be sufficient in most cases. For more information about the requirements
of the various systems, see the relevant Tzunami Deployer Exporter Guide. For
information about the requirements for connecting to SharePoint, see the Tzunami
Deployer Installation Guide.

Migration
Does Tzunami Deployer migrate folder structure? Does Tzunami Deployer migrate
Documents and lists metadata?

Tzunami Deployer extracts and enables the deployment and committing of any hierarchy
structure existing in the source system. Tzunami Deployer migrates metadata for sites,
lists, items, and files, including the system properties (Create, Created By, Modified, and
Modified By).

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate version history of documents?

Yes. Tzunami Deployer retains version history for items and documents with all relevant
metadata.

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate Document Policy Management? Does Deployer migrate
Alerts?

No. Tzunami Deployer is a data migrating tool and, as such, it does not support migrating
document policies or alerts.

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate Documents and Lists?

Yes. Tzunami Deployer supports migrating all kinds of containers and contained items
from the source system, including documents, data-items, folders, lists, libraries, and
sites.

Does Tzunami Deployer support the migration of all list types?

Yes. Tzunami Deployer supports the migration of all list types, including Document
Libraries, Issues, Tasks, Contacts, Announcements, Discussions, as well as custom lists.

Does Tzunami Deployer support multi-lingual migration?

Tzunami Deployer is not language-specific. Whatever the language your data is written in,
Tzunami Deployer will migrate it as-is.

Page | XI
Does Tzunami Deployer migrate layouts, themes, and headers of sites?

No. Tzunami Deployer is a content migration tool. Layouts, themes, and templates in
general are not part of the content and, therefore, are not migrated. However, you can
create your own custom templates in the target SharePoint and use those templates in
Tzunami Deployer.

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate Site Definitions?

The main site definitions of SharePoint reside on the SharePoint server and are not part of
the SharePoint data itself. For this reason, Tzunami Deployer does not support the
migration of site definitions. Custom site/list templates, on the other hand, reside in the
SharePoint libraries: “site/list template gallery”. These lists are read with Tzunami
Deployer and the contained item can be migrated to the target SharePoint. Note that any
dependency or inconsistency that might occur after migration is the responsibility of the
creator of the site/list template - Tzunami Deployer is responsible only for moving the
files.

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate regional settings? Does Tzunami Deployer migrate
workflows?

No. Tzunami Deployer is a data migration tool and, as such, it does not support migrating
non-data related definitions.

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate Personal sites?

Yes. Personal sites are treated as any site collection in Tzunami Deployer and can be
migrated along with their content.

Does Tzunami Deployer support site level migration? Does Tzunami Deployer support
item level migration?

Tzunami Deployer allows migration of content from any level in the source system to any
level in the target system.

Security

Does Tzunami Deployer migrate file system security?

Tzunami Deployer extracts file system security definitions and enables the mapping of
these to SharePoint security definitions. Security modeling is a complex topic — if you have
more questions about how exactly Tzunami Deployer supports security migration, contact

the Tzunami Support Team at support@tzunami.com.

wna SSCS

Migration Masters
Tzunam

Migration Masters

Does Tzunami Deployer support migrating permissions at the list level?

Tzunami Deployer enables the management of list-level permissions at any level, as well
as migration of security settings during the migration process. Security modeling is a
complex operation - we recommend consulting with the Tzunami Support Team at

support@tzunami.com on all aspects of your security migration needs.

Broken Links

Does Tzunami Deployer fix broken links?

Tzunami Deployer itself does not handle the fixing of relative links that refer to the source
system. Tzunami offers a redirection tool to solve such cases. For more information,

contact the Tzunami Support Team at support@tzunami.com.

Batch and Command Line Operations

Does Tzunami Deployer support creating a batch of migration operations that can be run
a scheduled time?

Yes. Tzunami Deployer works offline from SharePoint and commits all performed
operation in a batch style manner. You can schedule Tzunami Deployer as a command-line
tool to run at a scheduled time using the Windows Scheduled Tasks.

Remote Operation

Does Tzunami Deployer allow migration operations to be performed remotely?

When performing a migration to SharePoint 2003, Office 365 and SharePoint Server 2010
(without using remote service), all operations are done remotely.

When migrating to SharePoint 2007/ SharePoint 2010/ SharePoint 2013, Tzunami
Deployer requires a Windows Service component to be installed on the SharePoint server.
After installation, all Tzunami Deployer clients can communicate and function remotely.

Logging

Does Tzunami Deployer log migration operation results to a file?

Yes. All actions are logged for later reviewing in case of errors. Tzunami Deployer also
provides several XML reports for you.

UNDERSTANDING CLAIMS-BASED IDENTITY

For people who create applications, working with identity traditionally hasn’t been much fun. First, a
developer needs to decide which identity technology is right for a particular application. If the application
will be accessed in different ways, such as within an organization, across different organizations, and via
the public Internet, one identity technology might not be enough—the application might need to support
multiple options. The developer also needs to figure out how to find and keep track of identity
information for each of the application’s users. The application will get some of what it needs directly
from those users, but it might also need to look up other information in a directory service or someplace
else. IT administrators must also be involved to configure this software correctly. Add the cloud to the
mix, and things get even more complicated.

This is all more complex than it needs to be. Why not create a single interoperable approach to identity
that works in pretty much every situation, both on-premises and in the cloud? And rather than making
applications hunt for identity information, why not make sure that this single approach lets users supply
each application with the identity information it requires?

Claims-based identity achieves these goals. It provides a common way for applications to acquire the
identity information they need about users inside their organization, in other organizations, and on the
Internet. It also provides a consistent approach for applications running on-premises or in the cloud.

Taking advantage of claims-based identity requires developers to understand how and why to create
claims-based applications. It also requires infrastructure software that applications can rely on. This
overview describes the basics of claims-based identity, then looks at how a group of Microsoft
technologies help make this world a reality. Those technologies are Active Directory Federation Services
(AD FS) 2.0, the Windows Azure AppFabric Access Control service (ACS), and Windows Identity Foundation
(WIF).

THE PROBLEM: WORKING WITH IDENTITY IN APPLICATIONS

Sometimes, working with identity is simple. Think of a Windows application that doesn’t need to know
much about its users, for example, and that will be accessed only by people within a single organization.
This application can just rely on Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA), which uses Kerberos under the
covers. Kerberos is implemented as part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS, originally known as
just “Active Directory”), and it provides a way to authenticate users and convey basic information about
them. Or suppose you’re creating an application that will be accessed solely by Internet users. Again, the
common approach to handling identity is straightforward: just require each user to supply a username
and password.

Yet the requirements for modern applications are rarely this simple. What if you need more information
about each user than is provided by either Kerberos or a simple username and password? Your
application will now need to acquire this information from some other source, such as AD DS, or keep
track of the information itself. Or suppose the application must be accessed both by employees inside the
organization and by customers via the Internet—what now? Should the application support both Kerberos
and username/password-based logins? And what about the case where you'd like to let users from a
business partner access this application without requiring a separate login? This kind of access can’t be
accomplished very well with either Kerberos or username/password logins—more is required.
The right solution is to have one approach to identity that works in all of these scenarios. To be effective,
this single approach must be based on widely recognized industry standards that interoperate across both
platform and organizational boundaries. But standards alone aren’t enough. The solution also needs to be
widely implemented in products from multiple vendors and be simple for developers to use. This unified,
broadly supported approach is exactly what claims-based identity is meant to provide.

THE SOLUTION: CLAIMS-BASED IDENTITY

Claims-based identity is a straightforward idea, founded on a small number of concepts: claims, tokens,
identity providers, and a few more. This section describes the basics of this technology, starting with a
look at these fundamental notions.

Before launching into this description, however, there’s an important point to make. While this paper
focuses on the mechanics, using the technology described here can require more, such as business
agreements between different organizations. Addressing the technical challenges is essential, but they’re
not always the whole story.

Claims, Tokens, and STSs

What is an identity? In the real world, the question is hard to answer—the discussion quickly veers into
the metaphysical. In the digital world, however, the answer is simple: A digital identity is a set of
information about somebody or something. While all kinds of entities can have digital identities, including
computers and applications, we’re most often concerned with identifying people. Accordingly, this
overview will always refer to things with identities as “users”.

When a digital identity is transferred across a network, it’s just a bunch of bytes. It’s common to refer to a
set of bytes containing identity information as a security token or just a token. In a claims-based world, a
token contains one or more claims, each of which carries some piece of information about the user it
identifies. Figure 1 shows how this looks.

Token

Example Claims

~ Name
» Role

~ Age

Figure 1: A token contains claims about a user along with a digital signature that can be used to verify
its issuer.

Claims can represent pretty much anything about a user. In this example, for instance, the first three
claims in the token contain the user’s name, an identifier for a role she belongs to, and her age. Other
tokens can contain other claims, depending on what’s required. A claim might also indicate the user’s
right to do something, such as access a file, or restrict some right, such as setting an employee’s
purchasing limit. And while it’s common today to use tokens defined with the XML-based Security
Assertion Markup Language (SAML), this isn’t required. Web applications might use a simpler approach
called Simple Web Token (SWT), for example.

To verify its source and to guard against unauthorized changes, a token’s issuer digitally signs each token
when it’s created. As Figure 1 shows, the resulting digital signature is carried as part of the token.

But who issues tokens? In a claims-based world, tokens are created by software known as a security token
service (STS). Figure 2 illustrates the process.

Figure 2: A user acquires a token containing some set of claims from an STS.

In a typical scenario, an application working on behalf of a user, such as a Web browser or some other
client, asks an STS for a token containing claims for this user (step 1). Various protocols can be used to
make this request, but however it’s done, the STS authenticates the user in some way, such as by
validating her Kerberos ticket or checking her password (step 2). This lets the STS be certain that the user
is who she claims to be.

The request sent to an STS typically contains a URI identifying the application this user wishes to access.
The STS then looks up information about both the user and the application in a database (step 3). As the
figure shows, this database maintains account information and other attributes about users and
applications. Once the STS has found what it needs, it generates the token and returns it to the requester
(step 4).

Identity Providers and Identity Libraries

Claims, tokens, and STSs are the foundation of claims-based identity. They’re all just means to an end,
however. The real goal is to help a user present her digital identity to an application, then let the
application use this information to make decisions. Figure 3 shows a simple picture of how this happens.

Figure 3: A browser or other client can acquire a token from an STS, then present this token and the
claims it contains to an application.

As the figure shows, a Web browser or other client acting on behalf of a user gets a token for a particular
application from an STS (step 1). Once it has this token, the browser or client sends it to the application
(step 2), which is configured with a list of one or more trusted STSs. To process the token, the application
depends on an identity library, a reusable set of code for working with tokens and the protocols that
convey them. This library verifies the token’s signature, which lets the application know which STS issued
the token, then checks whether this STS is on the trusted list (step 3). If the application does trust the STS
that issued this token, it accepts the token’s claims as correct and uses them to decide what the user is
allowed to do or in other ways (step 4).

If the token contains the user’s role, for example, the application can assume that the user really has the
rights and permissions associated with that role. Since the user was required to authenticate herself to
get this token, the application doesn’t need to authenticate her again. (In fact, because it relies on the
claims in the token, an application is sometimes referred to as a relying party.)

Notice an important difference between what’s happening here and the way that applications frequently
handle identity: Rather than requiring the application itself to authenticate the user, claims-based identity
relies on the STS to do this. This gets developers out of the business of authenticating users, something
that definitely counts as progress. All an application needs to do is determine that the token a user
presents was created by an STS this application trusts. How the user proved its identity to this STS—with a
password, a digital signature, or something else—isn’t the application’s problem. This lets the application
be deployed unchanged in different contexts, a significant improvement over the usual situation today.

Although it’s not shown in the figure, there’s an essential first step before any of this can happen: An
administrator must configure the STS to issue the right claims for this user and this application. Without
this, the STS likely can’t create a token containing the claims that the application needs. While doing this
might seem like a burden, the reality is that this information must also be configured in the non-claims-
based world. The big difference is that now the claims are all in one place, accessible through the STS,
rather than spread across different systems.

Figure 3 also illustrates another important concept, which is that an STS can be owned by some identity
provider (IdP). Sometimes called an issuer, the identity provider is what stands behind the truth of the
claims in the tokens this STS creates. In fact, this is why the contents of a token are called “claims”:
They’re statements that this identity provider claims are true. An application that receives this token can
decide whether it trusts this identity provider and the claims it makes about this user.

Identity providers come in many forms. If you use a token issued by an STS on your company’s network,
for example, the identity provider is your company. If you use a token issued by the STS provided by a
service on the Internet, such as Windows Live ID, Facebook, or Google, this service is acting as the identity
provider. But whoever the identity provider is, being able to acquire and use a token containing claims is
useful.

To see why, think about the pre-claims world we (mostly) live in today. In this environment, an application
typically gets only simple identity information from a user, such as her login name. All of the other
information it needs about that user must be acquired from somewhere else. The application might need
to access a local directory service, for instance, or maintain its own application-specific database. With
claims-based identity, however, an application can specify exactly what claims it needs and which identity
providers it trusts, then expect each user to present those claims in a token issued by one of those
providers. A claims-aware application is still free to create its own user database, of course, but the need
to do this shrinks. Instead, each request can potentially contain everything the application needs to know
about this user.

Using Multiple Identity Providers

In many cases, a user has only one identity provider—and thus one STS—to choose. When you access an
application inside your organization, for example, the application might only accept tokens issued by your
company’s STS. In some situations, though, an application might accept tokens issued by multiple identity
providers—it might trust several different STSs.

For example, think about an application on the public Internet that wishes to let its users log in using a
Facebook identity, a Google identity, or a Windows Live ID identity. Since hundreds of millions of people
have accounts with these services, why not accept them? Or suppose the application wishes to accept
identities directly from multiple instances of Active Directory—what then? Both of these situations
require the application to trust multiple STSs at multiple identity providers, then to let the user choose
which one he wants to use. Figure 4 shows how this looks.

Figure 4: If an application accepts identities from multiple identity providers, the user can select which
one to use.

In this situation, the user accesses the application and learns which STSs it trusts (step 1). For example,
the application might provide a login screen that lets the user choose to use his Facebook identity, his
Google identity, or his Windows Live ID identity. The user then chooses one, and his browser or other
client software contacts that identity provider. This provider’s STS authenticates the user, perhaps by
requiring him to enter a username and password, then returns a token for this identity (step 3). As before,
this token is then sent to the application (step 4), which validates it as usual and uses the claims it
contains (step 4).

For some applications, accepting tokens from multiple identity providers, especially public providers,
makes no sense. Letting employees use their Facebook identity to log into a critical business application
inside your company probably isn’t a good idea. But there are plenty of situations where this can be
useful. Think of an enterprise application that must be accessible to employees, partners, and customers,
for example, or a consumer application on the public Internet that wishes to make login as painless as
possible. Addressing this requirement is an important part of modern identity technology.

Federation Providers

In a claims-based world, a user always initially gets her identity from an STS owned by some identity
provider. But suppose the application she wants to access doesn’t trust this STSs—what then? One
possibility is that there’s just no way for her to access this application. There’s also another option,
however: even though the application she wants to access doesn’t trust her STS, it might trust another
STS that in turn trusts her STS. This approach, called identity federation, is both common and useful. With
federation, an identity provider offers an STS as usual, but another STS is also offered by a federation
provider (FP). The federation provider STS is then configured by an administrator to trust the identity
provider STS. Figure 5 shows how a user can provide identity information to an application when
federation is used.

Figure 5: An STS can act as a federation provider, accepting one token and producing another.

As always, the process begins when the user accesses an application from a browser or another client,
learning which STSs that application trusts (step 1). Here, the application trusts only the federation
provider STS. The user’s browser or client software then contacts that federation provider, learning which
STSs it trusts (step 2). In this example, the federation provider STS is configured to trust the identity
provider’s STS, and so the user’s browser or client software contacts this STS. As usual, the user is
authenticated in some way, then gets back an IdP token created by this STS (step 3).

This token can’t be used to access the application, however, since that application doesn’t trust the STS
that issued it. Fortunately, this token can be used to acquire a token that the application will accept. To do
this, the browser or client software sends the IdP token to the federation provider (step 4). The federation
provider validates this token, ensuring that it came from an STS it trusts. Once it determines this, it
creates a new token for this user (step 5), then returns this FP token (step 6). The user’s software submits
this token to the application (step 7), which verifies that the FP token was issued by an STS that it trusts.
The application then uses the claims in the token as usual (step 8).

From the user’s point of view, all of these exchanges are invisible. She accesses the application without
explicitly logging into it, that is, she gets what’s known as single sign-on. The mechanics are a little more
complex, but the core idea underlying identity federation is straightforward. It is that not only
applications can trust STSs; one STS can trust another STS as well.

Step 5 in the figure is worth examining in more detail. As just described, the federation provider receives a
token issued by another STS, then generates a new token for the user. But exactly what claims does this
new token contain? The answer depends on what the federation provider’s STS is configured to do. In the
simplest case, it might copy every claim from the IdP token directly into the FP token unchanged. Ina
more realistic scenario, the federation provider STS performs claims transformation, emitting a token that
doesn’t contain the exact set of claims that it received from the identity provider.

For example, suppose the IdP token contains a claim indicating that this user is a member of the role
“Administrator”, expressing that claim as a character string containing this English word. It’s possible that
the application understands the administrator role, but expects the claim to be expressed as a numeric
code or in Chinese or in some other way. The federation provider can perform this translation, inserting a
claim in the correct format in the FP token it generates.

Claims transformation can do other things as well. When it creates the FP token, for example, the
federation provider might omit claims from the IdP token that aren’t meaningful to this application. Or it
might add claims to the FP token that aren’t present in the IdP token, such as an indication of the IdP that
issued the original token. Claims transformation is a powerful idea, and it can be used in a variety of ways.

IMPLEMENTING CLAIMS-BASED IDENTITY: MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES

Implementing claims-based identity requires several things. Identity provider STSs must be available to
issue tokens to users. Because identity federation is common, federation provider STSs are also essential.
And finally, developers will need to build claims-aware applications that know how to receive tokens and
use the claims they contain. Rather than having every developer write this code from scratch, it makes
sense to provide a standard identity library that any application can use.

The rise of cloud computing adds another requirement. All three of these things—an identity provider
STS, a federation provider STS, and an identity library—should be available both on premises (e.g.,
running in an organization’s data center) and in the cloud. Without this, some important scenarios are
hard to address.

The Microsoft platform for claims-based identity targets all of these options. Figure 6 summarizes the
technologies it includes today.

Figure 6: Microsoft provides cloud and on-premises technologies for an identity provider STS, a

In the cloud, Microsoft provides Windows Live ID as an identity provider STS, while Windows Azure
AppFabric Access Control provides a federation provider STS. For an identity library, applications can use
Windows Identity Foundation (WIF, commonly pronounced “Dub-I-F”).

For on-premises use, Microsoft makes available Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0. As Figure
6 shows, this technology can be used as both an identity provider STS and a federation provider STS. And
for an identity library, applications once again can use Windows Identity Foundation.

It’s important to note that while this overview focuses on Microsoft technologies, claims-based identity is
a multi-vendor effort. Given this, there are alternative technologies from other vendors for all of the
boxes in this figure. And because interactions among the parties are based on industry standards, the
offerings from Microsoft and other vendors can be combined in various ways. For example, using the
Microsoft identity platform doesn’t require relying on Windows Live ID for a cloud identity provider STS—
other providers, such as those from Google and Facebook, can also be used. Similarly, AD FS 2.0 isn’t the
only option for on-premises STSs; WIF can work with tokens created by products from IBM and other
vendors.

The focus here is on the Microsoft technologies, however, and the best way to understand how they fit
together is to walk through scenarios showing how they’re used. Before doing this, we first need to look
at the basics of each one.

WINDOWS LIVE ID

Windows Live ID implements an identity provider STS in the cloud. Today, the most popular applications
that accept tokens issued by this STS are Microsoft offerings such as Hotmail. Any application can choose
to accept these tokens, however—it’s not usable only by Microsoft itself.

The token provided by Windows Live ID contains a very simple set of claims, primarily just a globally
unique identifier. The structure of this identifier is opaque, which means that an application can’t derive
any meaning from the identifier’s content or structure. An application can use this value to recognize
individual users, however. For example, a Web site that accepts Windows Live ID logins might ask each
user for information such as his name and shipping address, then store this data along with the user’s
Windows Live ID identifier. The next time the user logs in, the application can use this identifier to look up
his information.

ACTIVE DIRECTORY FEDERATION SERVICES 2.0

Having an identity provider STS in the cloud is useful. But for enterprises, having one on-premises is much
more important. Business applications inside your organization probably don’t let employees log in with a
Windows Live ID, a Facebook identity, or any other token issued by an identity provider STS in the cloud.
Instead, they require a token issued by an STS that they control.

Active Directory Federation Services 2.0 can fill this role. As its name suggests, AD FS 2.0 is the follow-on
to the original Active Directory Federation Services technology. Don’t be misled by the word “federation”
in the technology’s name, however. In fact, AD FS 2.0 can act as either an identity provider STS ora
federation provider STS. The same AD FS 2.0 instance can even act in both roles simultaneously. And since
it’s part of Active Directory, AD FS 2.0 is available to current users at no extra cost. This makes claims-

11
based identity immediately accessible to the large number of organizations that use Active Directory
today.

AD FS 2.0 contains several advances over its predecessor. It supports both browsers and other clients, for
example, such as those built using Windows Communication Foundation (wcF)*. Also unlike the first AD
FS release, AD FS 2.0 supports the SAML 2.0 protocol as well as WS-Federation and WS-Trust, letting it
work in a broader range of environments.

The AD FS 2.0 STS can be used entirely inside an organization, exposed on the Internet, or both. The
claims it supplies can come from Active Directory Domain Services, of course, but this isn’t the only
choice. AD FS 2.0 also supports using SQL Server as an attribute store, that is, a source for claims, and
developers are free to create custom attribute stores as well. To help manage an organization’s attribute
stores, including Active Directory and others, Microsoft provides Forefront Identity Manager (FIM). This
technology offers a way to synchronize information across different attribute stores, along with an
identity management portal with pre-defined workflows for password resets, group management, and

more.

Yet it’s worth reiterating that claims-based identity doesn’t require using AD FS 2.0. Any STS from any
vendor (or even a custom-built STS) that supports standard protocols and token formats can be used. Still,
one of Microsoft’s primary goals in providing AD FS 2.0 is to make widely available a fully-featured STS
built on Active Directory. Ubiquitous STSs are fundamental to making the benefits of claims-based identity
real.

WINDOWS AZURE APPFABRIC ACCESS CONTROL

Identity federation is useful in many situations. For applications running on premises, such as a business
application within an enterprise, using a federation provider STS that’s also on premises is often the right
choice. But for an application running in the cloud, using a federation provider STS that runs in the cloud is
likely to be better. The Windows Azure AppFabric Access Control service fills that role.

ACS is most commonly applied today in two scenarios:

Letting an application running in the cloud accept tokens issued by multiple on-premises identity
provider STSs, such as AD FS 2.0. This can give on-premises users in various organizations single sign-
on to the cloud application. This is especially useful for independent software vendors (ISVs) who
wish to allow easy access to a Software as a Service (SaaS) application by customers in many different
enterprises.

Oo Letting an application running in the cloud accept identities issued by multiple cloud identity provider
STSs. ACS has built-in support for handling the protocols and token formats used by Windows Live ID,
Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and OpenID. An application that trusts the ACS federation provider STS can
choose to accept identities from any of these identity providers while still being shielded from the
idiosyncratic details of each one.

‘Inthe jargon of identity, AD FS 2.0 supports both active and passive clients, while the first release of AD FS supported only passive clients.

12
ACS also provides another important function: built-in support for claims transformation. As described
earlier, a federation provider STS commonly emits a token whose claims differ from the IdP token it
received. To help do this more intelligently, ACS includes a rules engine for defining these
transformations.

ACS lets clients request tokens using various protocols, including WS-Federation, WS-Trust, OpenID 2.0,
and OAuth 2.0. It can accept and issue tokens in various formats as well, including SAML 1.1, SAML 2.0,
and Simple Web Token (SWT). The technology also allows delegated authorization using OAuth 2.0, which
provides a controlled way for an application to act on behalf of a user.

WINDOWS IDENTITY FOUNDATION

Whether it’s offered by an identity provider or a federation provider, an STS creates tokens containing
claims. Yet those tokens are useless unless applications are able to accept and use them. The goal of WIF
is to make this easier by helping developers create claims-aware Windows applications.

WIF is a set of .NET Framework classes that implement essential identity functions, such as receiving a
token, verifying its signature, and accessing the claims it contains. It supports tokens created using either
the SAML 1.1 or SAML 2.0 formats, so it can accept tokens issued by AD FS 2.0, ACS, or STSs from other
vendors. WIF supports various standard protocols as well, including WS-Federation and WS-Trust, and it’s
extensible, allowing other technologies to be added. For example, Microsoft provides a sample WIF
extension that implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol with SWT tokens.

Each claim is extracted into an instance of a WIF-defined Claim class, providing a consistent way for
developers to work with a token’s information. This class’s properties include things such as:

ClaimType, indicating what kind of claim this is. Does the claim contain a user’s name, for example, or
a role, or something else? Claim types are identified by strings, which are just URIs.

Value, containing the actual content of the claim, such as the user’s name.

Issuer, which specifies the identity provider STS this claim came from. In other words, this is the
entity asserting that this claim is true.

Microsoft itself is using WIF to add support for claims-based identity to its own products, including
SharePoint 2010 and others.

Along with helping developers create claims-aware applications, WIF also provides support for creating a
custom STS. Even though a primary goal of AD FS 2.0 is to reduce the need to hand roll your own STS,
there are situations where building an STS can make sense. One important example of using WIF in this
way already exists: AD FS 2.0 itself is built on WIF.

USING CLAIMS-BASED IDENTITY: SCENARIOS

Getting your mind around claims-based identity requires understanding the basics of this technology. Still,
the best way to get a feel for the approach is to walk through examples of how it’s applied. Accordingly,
this section looks at a number of different ways that claims can be used both on premises and in the
cloud, each illustrated using the Microsoft technologies just described.

13
ON-PREMISES SCENARIOS

Claims-based identity was first used to address problems within and between enterprises. This is still
where the technology is most widely used today, and so it makes sense to look at on-premises scenarios
first. This section walks through three examples:

Accessing an enterprise application, where the application, the identity provider STS, and all of the
users are within the same organization.

Accessing an enterprise application via the Internet, which extends the first scenario to include
remote Internet access by users outside the organization.

Using identity federation between enterprises, where a user in one organization accesses an
application in another organization.

Accessing an Enterprise Application

Most enterprises act as an identity provider today, and nearly every enterprise application must deal with
identity. AD FS 2.0 and WIF can provide the foundation for using claims-based identity with on-premises
applications, those running inside an organization. Figure 7 shows how this looks.

User

Figure 7: An enterprise can use AD FS 2.0 and WIF to support claims-based identity for its internal
applications.

In this example, a user logs in using AD DS, getting an initial Kerberos ticket (step 1). The user then
accesses a claims-aware application built using WIF, learning which STSs it trusts (step 2). This application
only trusts the STS within its own enterprise, and so the user’s browser or client requests a token from

14
that STS, supplying a Kerberos ticket to authenticate the user (step 3). AD FS 2.0, acting as an identity
provider STS, verifies the ticket, then looks in AD DS for the information it needs to create the requested
token (step 4). Exactly what claims appear in this token depends on both the user requesting it and the
application that user is accessing—each application can indicate which claims it needs. Once the token
has been created, the AD FS 2.0 STS sends it back to the user’s browser or client (step 5), which sends it
on to the application (step 6). The application then uses WIF to verify the token’s signature and make its
claims available for use (step 7).

One big plus of a claims-based approach is worth re-emphasizing here: Rather than having to go look for
the information it needs about a user, the application can instead get everything handed to it in the
token. If the application needs, say, the user’s job title, it can specify this in its list of required claims.
When the STS creates a token for the application, it finds the user’s job title in AD DS and inserts it as a
claim that the application can use. Without this, the application developer must write his own code to dig
this information out of AD DS. Claims-based identity makes the developer’s life significantly easier.

Accessing an Enterprise Application via the Internet

Suppose this organization wishes to make this on-premises application accessible to remote employees
via the Internet. Rather than modifying the application to accept username/password logins, a traditional
solution, the same claims-based approach can be used—the application remains unchanged. Figure 8
shows how this looks.

15
Here, the user is on another computer outside the enterprise. As before, she accesses the application and
learns which STSs it trusts (step 1). Once again, the application trusts only the STS in its own enterprise,
and so the user’s browser or client requests a token from that STS. Implemented using AD FS 2.0, that STS
authenticates the user and sends back the token” (step 2). The user’s browser or client then submits this
token to the application (step 3). The application relies on WIF to verify the token, then uses the claims it
contains (step 4).

Rather than requiring the application to implement a different way of handling identity for Internet
access, a claims-based approach lets it handle this situation just like the inside-the-enterprise case. Still,
some extra complexity creeps in. When the user requests a token in step 2, for example, how does she
authenticate herself to the STS? Kerberos tickets work just fine for users inside the enterprise, as shown
earlier in Figure 7, but they don’t work as well for Internet users. Instead, the user might provide a
username and password in step 2 to authenticate her request, an option that Microsoft supports in AD FS
2.0. Since the users in this scenario are employees, they already have accounts in AD DS, and so they can
log in with no trouble.

But what if the users aren’t employees? Suppose the application needs to be exposed via the Internet to
customers as well. Can this approach still work? The answer, unsurprisingly, is yes. Although it’s not an
especially common option, information about external users can also be stored in AD DS, letting it be
accessed by AD FS 2.0.

But wait a minute: If Internet users still need usernames and passwords, how is the claims-based
approach making things better? One important improvement is that it frees each application from the
need to store sensitive password information, moving that responsibility instead to the much smaller
number of STSs. Also, users no longer have a password for each application. Instead, they’ll (at most) have
one for each STS they use. While claims-based identity doesn’t eliminate the need for usernames and
passwords, it does help make the world simpler and more secure.

Providing Single Sign-On to an Enterprise Application in Another Organization

Another common identity challenge is letting users in one organization access an application running in
some other organization. For example, suppose your company wishes to make an internal SharePoint site
accessible to employees at a partner firm. One way to do this is to give each of these external users their
own account in your company. While this approach works, it’s unappealing. Those users won’t like having
a separate login, and your firm’s administrators won’t like having to administer accounts for people
outside your company. Doing this also creates security risks—how can your administrators know when an
external user has left his company and so should no longer have an account?

A better solution is to let the external users access your application using their own identities. This
approach requires no separate logins and no new accounts. What it does require, however, is creating a
relationship between your firm and its partner. Doing this will likely require some kind of business

* To avoid opening the enterprise’s firewall, it’s possible to run an instance of AD FS 2.0 in a proxy role inside this organization’s DMZ. This
proxy then forwards requests to the full AD FS 2.0 service running inside the firewall.

16
agreement between the two organizations, a topic that’s beyond the scope of this discussion. It also, of
course, requires putting in place the right technology.

One approach is to configure an application running in one organization to trust the identity provider STS
in another. Figure 9 shows how this looks.

Figure 9: If the application trusts the STS in the client's enterprise, it can accept and use a token issued
by that STS.

In this scenario, a user in enterprise X accesses an application in enterprise Y and learns which STSs it
trusts (step 1). Here, that application is configured to trust both its own STS (the one in enterprise Y) and
the identity provider STS in enterprise X. All that’s required is for the user in enterprise X to get a token
from its own STS (step 2), then submit this token to the application (step 3). The application uses WIF to
verify the token and extract its claims, then uses those claims in any way it likes (step 4).

This solution is simple to understand, but it’s not without problems. Suppose this application has users in
several different enterprises, for instance. With the approach shown here, the application would need to
be configured to trust the identity provider STS in each one, an unappealing prospect. A better solution is
to use federated identity, introducing a federation provider STS into the mix. Doing this means that the
application only needs to trust its own STS, making life significantly simpler for the people who build and
administer this application. Figure 10 shows this more likely situation.

Figure 10: If the application trusts only the STS in its own enterprise, the client must get a token from
that STS to access the application.

This scenario starts in the same way: The user in enterprise X accesses an application in enterprise Y and
learns which STSs it trusts (step 1). This time, however, that application is configured to trust only its own
STS, the one in enterprise Y. Once it determines this, the browser or client on the user’s system contacts
the STS in enterprise Y to learn which STSs it trusts (step 2). Here, that STS is acting in the role of
federation provider, and so it’s configured to trust the STS in enterprise X. Accordingly, the user’s client or
browser requests a token from the enterprise X STS (step 3), which is acting in the role of identity
provider.

The application won’t accept this IdP token, however—it was issued by an STS that the application doesn’t
trust. Instead, the user’s browser or client submits the IdP token to the federation provider STS in
enterprise Y (step 4). Because this STS is configured to trust the STS in enterprise X, the enterprise Y STS
can verify the token it receives from enterprise X, then issue an FP token that allows this user to access
the application (step 5). The user presents this token to the application (step 6), and the application uses
WIF to verify the token and extract its claims. The application can now use these claims as usual (step 7).

Notice that the federation provider STS in enterprise Y is acting as a claims transformer, accepting a token
issued by STS X, then creating its own token. The contents of the token STS Y creates might well be
different from those in the token it receives from STS X—it’s free to add, remove, or modify the claims. In
fact, AD FS 2.0 provides a fairly sophisticated way for an administrator to define rules for these
transformations. It’s even possible to prohibit issuing tokens entirely when necessary.

18
Notice also how convenient it is for the application to get the information it needs about a user directly in
the token. When both user and application are in the same organization, the application might be able to
access, say, AD DS directly to get information such as the user’s job title. When they’re in different
organizations, as in the scenario shown here, the application almost certainly won’t be allowed to do this.
Getting everything it needs handed to it in the user’s token is very nice indeed.

One final issue worth discussing is this: In step 2 above, the federation provider STS directs the user’s
browser or client to an identity provider STS. But if the federation provider STS trusts multiple identity
providers, as it probably does, how does it know which one it should send this user to? This problem is
known as home realm discovery, and there are several possible solutions. One option, which AD FS 2.0
supports, is to present the user with a list of possibilities, letting her choose the one she recognizes as her
own organization. Another option is to have the user provide her email address, then let the federation
provider STS infer her identity provider from the address’s domain name. However it’s done, using
identity federation typically requires solving this problem in some way.

CLOUD SCENARIOS

On-premises scenarios are important, but more and more applications run in the cloud. Using claims-
based identity can simplify life for developers and users here, too. Once again, it’s useful to look at several
possibilities:

Accessing a cloud-based application, where the user and the identity provider STS are inside an
enterprise, but the application is running in the cloud.

o Using cloud-based identity federation, which extends the first scenario by adding a federation
provider STS that runs in the cloud.

Using multiple identity providers with cloud-based federation, where an application running in the
cloud uses a cloud-based federation provider STS to accept identities issued by multiple identity
provider STSs.

Providing Single Sign-On to an Enterprise Application in the Cloud

Suppose a developer wants to build an application on a cloud platform, such as Windows Azure or
Amazon Web Services, then make it available to users in her enterprise. Or suppose an enterprise decides
to move an existing on-premises application to a cloud platform. How can users in the enterprise access
this application without having a separate login with its own username and password?

One approach is to configure the application to trust the enterprise’s identity provider STS. Figure 11
shows how this might look.

Figure 11: An enterprise can use AD FS 2.0 and WIF to provide single sign-on to an application running in
the cloud.

This scenario isn’t really new; in fact, it’s very similar to the first scenario shown back in Figure 7. As in
that example, the user accesses the application and learns which STS it trusts (step 1), then gets a token
from that STS (step 2). Although it’s not shown in the figure, the user probably authenticates himself to
the STS using a Kerberos ticket, just as in Figure 7. Once the user has a token from this identity provider
STS, his browser or client submits it to the application (step 3). The application uses WIF to validate and
process the token, then uses the claims as usual (step 4).

From the user’s point of view, this looks just like accessing an on-premises application. And since the
application is configured to trust the identity provider STS in enterprise X, there’s no need for identity
federation. This simple scenario can work well for cloud applications used by a single enterprise.

Providing Single Sign-On to a SaaS Application

In the identity federation scenario shown earlier in Figure 10, the federation provider STS ran inside the
same organization as the application being accessed. This isn’t required, however. As long as the
application trusts the federation provider STS, that STS can run anywhere—even in the cloud.

Windows Azure AppFabric Access Control is exactly that: a federation provider STS that runs in the cloud.
While it can be used by applications running either on-premises or in the cloud, the most interesting ACS

20
scenarios today are for cloud-based applications. For example, suppose a SaaS application wishes to
provide single sign-on to users in many organizations, each with its own identity provider STS. While it
would be possible to configure the application to trust the STS in each organization, doing this is
problematic. A better solution is to use ACS. Figure 12 shows how the interaction works with one of those
organizations.

Figure 12: A cloud application can use the Access Control service as a federation provider STS, making it

easier to offer single sign-on to users in multiple enterprises.

Although the figure looks a bit different, this is really just another example of federation like those shown
earlier. Here’s what happens, step by step:

As before, the user accesses the application and learns that it trusts only the federation provider STS
provided by ACS (step 1).

The user’s browser or client contacts that STS to learn which STSs it trusts, a list that includes the STS
in enterprise X (step 2).

The browser or client gets a token from this identity provider STS, implemented here with AD FS 2.0
(step 3).

The browser or client sends the token to the ACS STS (step 4).

The ACS STS validates this IdP token, then creates an FP token using the ACS rules engine (step 5).
This new token may well contain some claims that are different from those in the original AD FS
token; as usual, the federation provider STS can perform claims transformation.

The token created by ACS is then returned to the browser or client (step 6).

21
The browser or client sends the token to the application (step 7).
The application uses WIF to validate the FP token, then uses the claims it contains (step 8).

Notice how using ACS as a federation provider STS simplifies life for the cloud application. Rather than
trusting the identity provider STS in each of its customers, it can instead trust only the ACS STS. Because
ACS is explicitly designed to handle this kind of federation scenario, configuring it to trust various identity
provider STSs is straightforward. Using this cloud-based federation provider STS also lets the application
rely on the rules engine ACS provides, giving it one place to define any necessary claims transformations.
Rather than dealing with diverse tokens issued by diverse identity provider STSs, the application always
gets a token in the same format containing an expected set of claims.

Allowing Logins with Facebook, Google, and Other Cloud Identity Providers

In the example just described, the identity provider STSs were assumed to be inside enterprises, and so
they were provided by technologies such as AD FS 2.0. For a SaaS vendor providing a multi-tenant
business application, this is a common situation. But think about a cloud application that’s used mostly by
consumers rather than business users. Consumers don’t get their identities from AD FS 2.0—pretty much
nobody runs Active Directory in their home. Instead, people rely on cloud identity providers such as
Google, Facebook, Windows Live ID, and Yahoo.

Accepting these identities can make life simpler for a cloud application’s users. For the creators of the
application, however, doing this introduces some complexities. Because these identity providers use
different protocols and token formats—they don’t all conform to a single standard—implementing
support for them is non-trivial. And without a federation provider STS, the cloud application must be
configured to trust all of them.

The Access Control service addresses both problems. It’s designed to maintain trust relationships with
multiple identity providers, as already described, and it also has built-in support for the protocols and
token formats used by today’s most popular cloud identity providers. Because of this, using ACS can make
it simpler for cloud applications to accept diverse identities. Figure 13 shows how this looks.

Figure 13: The Access Control service makes it easier for an application to accept identities from

Once again, this is really just a federation scenario like those already described, and so it starts with the
user accessing the application and learning which STSs it trusts (step 1). Here, the only directly trusted STS
is provided by ACS, as the figure shows. But suppose this application will actually accept identities from,
say, Google and Facebook—how does it convey this to the user? One popular option is to display icons on
the login page presented to the user for each identity provider that this application trusts, then let the
user select the one it wishes to use, which is what’s done here (step 2). Once this choice has been made,
the user’s browser contacts the chosen identity provider STS. This STS authenticates the user, probably by
making him enter a username and password, then returns a token for this identity (step 3).

The application doesn’t directly trust the identity provider STS, however, so the user’s browser must send
this newly received IdP token to ACS (step 4). An administrator has configured the ACS STS to indicate that
this application trusts both Google and Facebook, and so once it has verified that the incoming token is
from one of these identity providers, the ACS STS creates a new token (step 5). This FP token is returned
to the user’s browser (step 6), then forwarded to the application (step 7). As usual, the application relies
on WIF to validate the FP token, then uses the claims it contains (step 8).

As the figure shows, ACS has built-in support for Windows Live ID, Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and any
identity provider that uses OpenID 2.0. As the figure also shows, however, this scenario only supports
Web browsers—these cloud identity providers don’t currently allow any other option. Another challenge
with cloud identity providers is that they typically provide only very simple claims. Recall, for instance,
that Windows Live ID sends just an opaque unique identifier. An application is free to request other
information from the user, of course, then store that information itself, but ACS doesn’t provide a service
to do this.

23
CONCLUSION

Without claims-based identity, application developers are faced with a diverse set of scenarios, each with
its own identity solution. Using claims-based identity collapses all of these down to just one problem: How
does an application get information about a user from a trusted source? As this overview has shown,
claims-based identity provides a consistent answer across a wide range of scenarios, both on premises
and in the cloud. And even though the technologies described in this overview are from Microsoft, there
are no proprietary links between them; all communication is based on industry standards.

Changing how people and applications work with identity is not a small thing. The whole world needn’t
change at once, however. Claims-based applications can be built and deployed alongside existing
applications, which makes migration to this much-improved approach simpler. And with the advent of AD
FS 2.0, Windows Azure AppFabric Access Control, and Windows Identity Foundation, all of the pieces
required to use claims-based identity on Windows are here.

Claims-based identity is far from a Microsoft-only initiative—many vendors are involved. Still, making
these components widely available for Windows is bound to make the approach more popular. For
anyone who cares about improving the way we use identity in the digital world, this is certainly a step
forward.

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT STATE OF SHAREPOINT AND OUT-OF-
CONTROL STORAGE GROWTH

SharePoint is an invaluable tool for document management and collaboration and the ideal platform for
web-based environments, including intranets and extranets. As such its popularity has grown exponentially,
80 percent of Fortune 500 companies use SharePoint’ and the latest data suggests that Microsoft adds more
than 20,000 users each day. SharePoint’s document management capabilities are of particular interest, with
enhanced document and information controls that allow for a better experience. In fact, according to a survey
by Collaboris? , users cite document management as the major use of SharePoint within their organizations.

With this growth, however, comes storage challenges. Despite recent improvements in the way SharePoint
stores documents, SharePoint remains a poor choice for storing the unstructured content like documents,
images and videos that dominates SharePoint. If not addressed, these storage limitations can lead to
performance issues—making it even more important to implement controls on SharePoint content growth
and devise a plan to manage it.

This whitepaper will explore SharePoint storage constraints and suggest steps that organizations can take to
limit the impact that content growth has on their mission-critical environments.

HOW RAPID SHAREPOINT GROWTH INHIBITS PERFORMANCE

Simply put, the larger the content - rich media, large repositories of content, etc. - the higher the performance
requirement. Subsequently, environments that grow too large have a negative impact on overall performance.
Pages can take longer to load and users quickly tire of waiting for content to refresh, which, in turn, has a
negative effect on platform adoption.

These storage concerns stem from the fact that SharePoint demands a high degree of performance from its
storage infrastructure. These performance metrics are directly related to the total amount of space that is
taken up by the databases. Specifically, Microsoft has determined that SharePoint content databases typically
use between 0.05 IOPS/GB and 0.2 IOPS/GB. For optimum performance, Microsoft recommends 0.5 IOPS/
GB. This means that any disk infrastructure must be robust enough to support a fairly high IOPS total. The
bigger the data store, the higher the requirements. Table 1 illustrates how many IOPS are required for various
content database sizes.

27TB 400 1000
5TB 1,000 2,500

20TB 4,000 10,000

Considering that many disk drives can provide 150-300 IOPS apiece, it is obvious that a large number of
disk spindles are required to support a growing environment. If the number of IOPS doesn’t match the
growth, there will be a gradual degradation in performance over time. In order to keep up with the growth,
administrators may need to over-provision disks to maintain the recommended number of IOPS, ending up
with a larger number of disks with unused capacity on each. This is especially true today as the average disk
size of a disk is increasing without an equivalent matching rise in the amount of IOPS capable per each disk.

For example, Table 2 shows sample disk architecture options that would provide approximately 1000 IOPS.
Considering that the maximum recommended IOPS required for 2TB of storage is 1000 IOPS, many of these
configurations result in a large amount of wasted space: up to 7TB in total. So we can see that planning
the disk infrastructure is highly dependent on the total number of IOPS per-disk, the RAID chosen, and the
number of disks in the drive set.

HOW RAPID SHAREPOINT GROWTH CHALLENGES IMPACT STORAGE

While growing SharePoint environments can inhibit performance, rapid growth can also have an immediate
impact on storage. To understand why, let’s look at how information is stored in SharePoint.

SharePoint runs as a three-tiered application, as shown in Figure 1. The first tier, the web tier, is the tier that
runs Internet Information Services (IIS) and serves up web content to clients directly. This is the tier that the
clients connect directly to via HTTP or HTTPS and is often load-balanced for availability.

Figure 1: Three Tiers of SharePoint Architecture

The second tier is a service application tier, which is used to run the multiple services that are consumed by
numerous systems within a SharePoint environment, both within the immediate farm and sometimes outside
of the farm itself. These service applications include Search, Excel Services, PerformancePoint, the Managed
Metadata Service, and the User Profile Synchronization Service.

The third SharePoint tier is the data tier, where all the information that is shared and managed within SharePoint
is kept. With the exception of search indexes, this information is stored within Microsoft SQL Server databases.
By default, this includes all content within SharePoint, both structured, such as the metadata and contextual
information, and unstructured, such as the actual documents themselves. These unstructured objects, known
as Binary Large Objects (BLOBs), degrade performance and create SharePoint database sprawl, which is hard,
time consuming and expensive to manage.

These content databases are simply SQL databases used for storage of the content that is created and
consumed in the SharePoint environment.

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

SHREDDED STORAGE IN SHAREPOINT 2013 ATTEMPTS TO PUT THINGS RIGHT

Prior to the release of SharePoint 2013, SharePoint stored every version of every file as a full-sized BLOB, which
led to significant database size growth. SharePoint 2013, on the other hand, introduced a concept known
as “Shredded Storage’, in which only the first version of a document is stored as a full-sized BLOB, and each
subsequent version stores only the changes made between versions. This reduces the steepness of the total
storage growth curve for SharePoint and also cuts down on data redundancy.

One disadvantage to shredded storage, however, is the fact that there is a performance cost associated with
reassembling the BLOB versions. Natively, SharePoint will always serve up BLOBs directly from SQL Server, a
process that can be up to two-times slower than accessing data from other storage mechanisms. In addition,
shredded storage cannot be applied retroactively. In other words, documents that are migrated from
SharePoint maintain their full BLOB sizes for older versions.

Despite the introduction of shredded storage, environments that measure their SharePoint storage tier sizes
in terabytes are still common. In fact, this has become the norm for even mid-sized or smaller organizations.
Because of the aforementioned performance issues, as well as the need to house the data, organizations must
pay close attention to how they architect the data tier and how they manage their data. It is important to
understand Microsoft's official and updated guidance on this topic as well which we'll look at next.

MICROSOFT GUIDANCE ON STORAGE SIZES AND LIMITATIONS

The guidance from Microsoft on SharePoint storage restrictions and size limitations can be confusing and
is further complicated by the fact that the information was last updated in SharePoint 2010 Service Pack 1.
Because the design of a storage environment for SharePoint is tightly intertwined with this information, it is
critical to understand Microsoft's guidance.

CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

There are a few key limitations and restrictions of SharePoint components that factor into storage design
for SharePoint 2013. Within a SharePoint farm content is housed within logical groupings known as web
applications. Each SharePoint farm can house up to 500 content databases. While there is room for expansion
at the content database tier, (each content database can house up to 2500 non-personal site collections) a
single site collection can exist only in one content database - it cannot span multiple content databases.

In some cases, organizations may choose to keep all or the majority of their content within a single site

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

collection. This practice can lead to very large content database sizes, which complicates storage management
planning and can lead to the performance issues previously indicated. Indeed, best practices for SharePoint
environments generally dictate that content should be distributed across a document management
environment in multiple site collections that are stored in multiple content databases, as illustrated in Figure
2. This can help improve performance by decreasing the density of the number of rows within the content
database, which can have a positive impact on performance.

Figure 2 shows a sample organization that deployed multiple site collections for each business unit and
distributed their data across content databases in that manner, allowing for smaller overall databases and
avoiding situations where all content is stored in a single database.

Figure 2: Distributing Content across Multiple Content Databases

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

While this concept is ideal, it is not always followed and comes with some challenges. For example, Microsoft
makes the default navigation structure at the site collection level, so any type of menu-based navigation
across site collections must be created by the custom development of the master pages in SharePoint. For this
and other reasons related to natural organic growth of the SharePoint environment, many organizations may
end up with very large content database sizes. This becomes problematic given Microsoft's recently updated
guidance on database sizes and the role this plays in the architecture of the data tier.

MICROSOFT GUIDANCE ON CONTENT DATABASE SIZES

With the release of Service Pack 1 for SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Foundation 2010, Microsoft
updated its recommendations for content database sizes. These recommendations also carry over to
SharePoint 2013 environments. Previous recommendations capped database sizes at 200GB for each content
database for collaboration sites and 1TB for document archives. The maximum recommended size has been
expanded to a whopping 4TB for normal scenarios and unlimited database sizes for records management or
archive scenarios. The only hard limitation then becomes the restriction to a maximum of 60 million objects
in any single content database. This represents a large amount of items, but is not an unprecedented number
in some larger SharePoint deployments.

The change in Microsoft's upper recommendation limits for content database sizes in Service Pack 1 was a
result of usage reassessment and the addition of the ability to recover sites that have been deleted from a
newly created “Site Recycle Bin” What Microsoft found is that one of the main reasons that administrators
restore databases is to recover deleted sites. Since that is no longer a major issue post-2010 SP1, Microsoft
updated their guidance and started to allow for massive database sizes. It's important to note that the
previous 200GB size “limitation” was not an actual limitation at all, and SQL would allow databases that were
much larger than that. Organizations with massive pre-2010 SP1 databases, however, found themselves in a
tricky spot and were forced to recover an entire database simply to restore a single deleted site.

This doesn’t mean that we advocate that organizations should immediately go out and create massive content
databases. In fact, very large content databases can still have a negative impact on the overall functionality
and the design possibilities available. For example, high availability and disaster recovery can be complicated
by massive database sizes, since technologies such as SQL Mirroring and Log Shipping do not work well on
larger databases. Traditional restore techniques can also take too long in these scenarios. It can also be more
difficult to move data around to rebalance the load on SQL Servers when databases are extremely large.

A MORE EFFICIENT ROUTE TO IMPROVING SHAREPOINT STORAGE
PERFORMANCE

The architectural limitations of SharePoint’s data tier coupled with its high disk IOPS requirements is driving
organizations to seek new ways of improving SharePoint performance without investing significant funds in
their storage infrastructure.

SharePoint storage can be expensive business. Organizations must factor in the cost of high-performance SAN
and NAS infrastructures combined with the lOPS requirements of dealing with a large document management
repository. These costs alone can dwarf the other budget items required to implement SharePoint. Clearly,
organizations need a better way to manage SharePoint performance without the massive investment at the
storage tier.

One simple way to improve the performance of the data tier is to break a content database into multiple
pieces. This can be done by creating multiple distinct files for each content database within SQL Management
Studio. These files can then be distributed across different storage volumes, as illustrated in Figure 3. If the
database files are distributed across separate disk aggregates, better performance is achieved at the data
tier resulting in faster page loads. Administrators don’t need to span multiple disk aggregates to get better
performance, since multiple files for each database can result in better parallelization of the database traffic.

Figure 3: Distribution of Content Database Files across Volumes

| i a cl

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

In Figure 3, a total of four files were created for each database. For example, DB-A is broken into four files
distributed across four volumes, as is DB-B. In addition, it is important to do the same for the SQL tempdb
file, which is a critical file for SharePoint performance. As illustrated in Figure 3, the rough calculation used to
determine how many files to create is directly related to the number of physical processors in use on the SQL
Server used by SharePoint. In this case, there are four physical processors, which is why the total number of
files created is four. You may run into guidance that dictates that the number of files created should equal
the number of processor cores, but this guidance originated with SQL 2000 testing and is not as accurate for
today’s modern multi-core processors. There is no perfect equation for this process and, since creating too
many files does not necessarily lead to performance issues, the best practice in this case is to distribute by
number of physical processors, not the number of cores.

Each of the storage partitions that house SharePoint content should also be write-optimized, to allow them
to handle the increased number of write operations that are performed. The ideal RAID level for SharePoint
content is RAID 0+1, which ensures the highest performance and availability options. RAID 5 can be a cost-
effective option that results in larger drive sizes, but administrators should be cautious about ensuring that
the number of IOPS required is maintained as RAID 5 does not provide the same level of performance as RAID
0+1.

IMPROVING STORAGE PERFORMANCE WITH REMOTE BLOB STORAGE (RBS)

One possible option for improving SharePoint storage is to take advantage of technologies that allow the
actual documents and files to be stored outside of the content database, thereby keeping the overall size
much lower. This is known as Remote BLOB Storage (RBS). As discussed earlier, a BLOB is the format in which
all documents and files are stored within the content databases. This type of data is known as unstructured
data and SQL Server has not traditionally been the best place to store this type of content. SQL Server works
better if it is given structured data to work with, such as metadata and the context of files. Using a process
such as RBS, organizations can extract BLOBs from the SQL databases and store them on alternative storage, as
shown in Figure 4. This approach provides the benefit of managing content from within SharePoint, without
incurring the performance and storage hit associated with physically storing BLOBs in a SQL Server database.

Figure 4: Understanding Remote BLOB Storage (RBS)

RBS Content DB

=> w/o BLOBs

Content DB with BLOBs Alternative Storage

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

Since the majority of content in the average SharePoint content database is typically composed of BLOB files,
by storing content outside of the SQL content database, the size of the database itself can be reduced up to
95 percent. This opens up a myriad of different architectural options for SharePoint, such as the ability to tier
or segment the storage, or the ability to create complex archiving policies.

Out-of-the-box, Microsoft provides a tool — “FILESTREAM provider” — that allows for RBS to be implemented
with SharePoint, but there are some significant limitations to FILESTREAM provider:

+ It lacks basic features for enterprise deployments, including:
o No user interface
o Lack of support for remote storage
o No multi-threading for garbage collection

+ RBS does not bypass SQL Server for BLOB processing; it pulls the BLOB out and redirects right back to SQL
Server using FILESTREAM Column Type

+ Backing out of FILESTREAM is difficult and time consuming

For this reason, it is recommended to use a third-party tool that can take advantage of the RBS features. These
tools provide additional functionality well beyond that provided by the FILESTREAM provider, which was
released by Microsoft as a sample provider, not as a fully baked solution. Additional functionality provided
by third-party tools include using RBS to take advantage of storage tiers that may be remote, such as cloud
storage, slower and cheaper SATA disk volumes, and even keeping the data on file servers while accessing it
in SharePoint via RBS, a concept known as a Shallow File Copy.

An additional advantage of using RBS to store the BLOBs on an alternate storage location is that it opens up
the environment for the use of data de-duplication options that were previously not accessible when the
BLOBs were stored within the content databases. Many SAN vendors offer de-duplication at the block level
for content within their flat file volumes, so if data is repeated multiple times, the repetitive part of that data is
only stored once. Since one version of a document may be 90 percent similar to the last version in SharePoint,
by storing the nearly identical BLOBs on the de-duplicated SAN volume, the overall space taken up by the files
themselves can be reduced. Check first with your SAN vendor to see if this is supported, but it is an option that
provides a way to deal with large document management environments.

THE SHAREPOINT MVP GUIDE TO OPTIMIZING STORAGE AND PERFORMANCE

CONCLUSION

Because of SharePoint’s robust disk requirements of up to 0.5 IOPS per GB, organizations with rapidly growing
SharePoint environments are trapped between limiting SharePoint adoption and use or needing a significant
investment in SharePoint specific storage. Fortunately for these organizations, there are methods that can
rein-in storage growth while maintaining performance.

These methods include simple techniques such as creating multiple files for each SharePoint content
database, but they can also include advanced options such as RBS, which drastically reduces the size of
SharePoint content databases, allowing them to maintain their speed requirements while storing the BLOBs
in an alternative, cheaper location.

Organizations planning for growth within their SharePoint environment should also consider these options—
or run the risk of storage performance issues eventually sabotaging their plans for SharePoint.

Proposed Detailed flow for online registration portion & payment portion (Took in reference of our other
programme type who is using CRM2016 as well,is quite feasible to have them) :

Online registration input by course pax for SIP > Application route to event IC for processing & Application Acknowledgement Email auto sent
to course pax > Event IC checked application in order and accept course pax’s application > Change the application status of applicant in CRM
to “Offer” > Autotrigger Application Acceptance email sent to course pax (Contents will mention the payment amount applicable for course
pax (should be auto detect from CRM), type of payment mode/deadline, information they need to have before they proceed to the url &
comes with an url to lead applicant to another webpage: Online Acceptance Page (Course pax can choose whether they accept or reject offer) .
If they accept, they can choose the payment mode (Online Credit Card / Telegraphic Transfer / Bank Draft).

a) if the person choose Online Credit Card payment, reflect the correct fee amount to be charged to applicant > prompt applicant to input
payment details online > Transaction completed successfully > Payment Mode auto reflected in CRM as Credit Card. Payment Amount
Received: Auto indicated the received amount in crm.)

b) If the person choose Telegraphic Transfer, prompt to upload attachment of their telegraphic transfer proof of advice from Bank > Auto
Route to our Finance for followup to track if the remittance was received and the amount received & Payment Mode should auto reflected in
CRM as Telegraphic Transfer > Finance update the status in CRM > Payment Amount Received: Finance indicates the actual received payment
amount in crm.)

¢) If the person choose Bank Draft > Payment Mode should auto reflected in CRM as Bank Draft > Event IC follows up manually with course
pax > course pax submit bank draft to event IC > Event IC manually submit to Finance for followup to track if the Bankdraft amount was
received and the amount received > Finance update the status in CRM > Payment Amount Received: Finance indicates the actual received
payment amount in crm.)

Concurrently, once the course pax choose to “Accept the offer” > to auto trigger email sent of selected required details of course pax (Self
Sponsored: Participant’s Name & mailing address of course pax or University Sponsored: University Billing Contact Details) to Finance to
create SAP record (this will be used by Finance to create Invoice and Receipt).

SharePoint authentication mechanisms will be leveraged such as AD authentication
Roles and Security for internal users will be implemented using SharePoint 2010 Out-of-

The course category will be static content in SharePoint. New page need to be created
and included in navigation for new category.

The static content should be managed from SharePoint.

5 different filtering options will be incorporated in course listing page. Since the data is in
CRM, user may experience delay in page loading. No search field will be included.

No additional design elements will be added.

NTU should provide the master page with page navigation option. TeBS SharePoint team
works only for the body content.

TeBS will use SLC content template for Short Courses. Thus, the screen responsive follows
the same. No enhancement in responsiveness can be done.

The applicant registration form will be developed by NTU. TeBS CRM team will share

Scalability

© The single most critical reason for using
multiple Site Collections is scalability

© Limit Content Databases to 200GB

® Limit Site Collections to 100GB

e If you must go over 100GB then use only 1 site
collection in the content database

e You will encounter performance issues and
possibly deadlock conditions

e Split Site Collections approaching 100GB into a
new Site Collection in a separate content
database (PowerShell)

© Watch out for the second stage recycle bin!

Backup/Restore

© Full fidelity backups are only possible at
the Site Collection level
© SharePoint 2010 Allows Sub-Site and

e Not Full Fidelity
© Cannot restore recycle bin, workflows, alerts,
personalization settings, auditing data
® 3 party solutions offer full fidelity
recovery at more granular levels

\_APTILLON A@UWOWLWONLL
Security

© Site Collections allow security groups and
permissions to be isolated from each other

© Management is more complex with Site Collections

e Difficult to see what access a user has across Site
Collections

e No OOTB way to synchronize across Site Collections
© Avoid breaking inheritance where possible
e May result in unforeseen/undesirable consequences
e Site Collections can reduce the need to break inheritance
© For large deployments Site Collections can help

Recycle Bin

© Each Site Collection has a First and Second
Stage Recycle Bin

e First Stage counts towards the Quota

e Second Stage does not count towards the Quota

© Be aware of the defaults — 30 days in the first stage
and 50% of the Site Collection Quota for the second
stage

© If there’s no quota then the second stage will grow
infinitely
© For large Site Collections change the 2"" stage
to ~20% and Quota to < ~80GB

the recommended 100GB allotment

the course, based on their personal particulars and other factors.
The details of the module consist of various components like —

e Subsidy Type

e Subsidy Setup

e Course Event Fee Structure

e Participant Fee Structure

Users can be:

= Entered directly using their username, email address or full name
and will be resolved where possible against the SharePoint user list
or Active Directory.

= Searched for: click on the address book icon on the right.

Please note that users that are external to the SharePoint environment can be added
as Assignees by specifying their email address. However, the only way that they
can respond to the Task is through LazyApproval, as they will have no access to the
SharePoint site.

Select People and Groups

To search for users, click on the address book icon on the right.

3) Search for people and groups from the directory, add external email addresses or select addresses from the lookup list.

The configuration dialog allows the workflow designer to search for and/or add users to
the Assignees list by one or more of the following methods:

e Internal Search: Entering a partial display name, email address or user account
name and clicking on the magnifying glass will provide a list of matching users
and groups from SharePoint as well as Active Directory.

e External email address: Enter an external email address manually. Where
possible Nintex Workflow will resolve this to an actual user account.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e Lookup: Provides the option of adding a dynamic reference as an approver. e.g.
Workflow variable, list field.

Click the title bar to expand or collapse each option.

Create individual tasks for all group members

In the case where a group is assigned the task and Create individual tasks for all group
members checkbox is:

e Not selected - all users in that group will receive the task notification. However,
the first respondent will represent the entire group.
e Selected - an individual task will be assigned to every member of the group.

Groups will only be expanded to one level. Groups within groups will not be expanded.

Allow delegation

When this option is selected, the assignee at runtime can delegate the task to another user.
For more information, please refer to Delegating Approval Tasks. Changing the 'Allow
delegation' option on the 'Action' screen is the same as changing the 'Allow delegation'
option for all assignees on the 'Task Notification' ribbon option. See the 'Task
Notification' ribbon option section below for more information.

Allow LazyApproval

If LazyApproval has been enabled, the workflow can permit the assignees to use
LazyApproval. Lazy Approval means that a task response can be registered when the
assignee replies to a notification email or an automated OCS / Lync conversation with a
recognized word or phrase. An administrator can edit or add to the list of acceptable
terms. For more information, please refer to the Managing LazyApproval

settings. Changing the allow LazyApproval option on the 'Action' ribbon option is the
same as changing the 'Allow LazyApproval' option for all assignees on the 'Task
Notification' ribbon option. See the 'Task Notification' ribbon option section below for
more information.

Task description

Allows entry of dynamic text that will display on the task response form. This can be
used to communicate additional information about the task to the responding
user. References can also be inserted using the Inserting reference fields feature.

Outcomes

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
The Outcomes define all the possible responses to the task. When completing the task,
assignees must choose from one of the listed outcomes.

New Outcomes can be added by clicking Add outcome or removing/editing existing
outcomes using the icons.

Each outcome is configured with a name and an optional description, which is displayed
on the task response form and can be used to provide instructions and more detail.
Whether or not the assignee must provide comments for the outcome can be configured
as optional, required or none.

Behaviour

There are five behavioural alternatives to instruct Nintex Workflow how to handle
tasks with multiple assignees. These are:

e First response applies: The first response received will be used for the
overall outcome. All other pending tasks will be set to 'not required"".

e Majority must choose a specific outcome: The majority of assignees
must agree on the same outcome. If a majority is not reached, the 'outcome
achieved' variable will be set to 'no' and the overall task outcome will be
blank. As soon as Nintex Workflow determines that a majority cannot be
reached, the action will complete and all pending tasks will be set to 'not
required’.

e All must agree on a specific outcome: All assignees must select the
outcome specified in the 'Outcome' drop down list. If any assignee
chooses an alternative outcome, all pending tasks will be set to 'not
required’, the 'outcome achieved! variable will be set to 'no' and the overall
task outcome will be blank.

e Majority decides: The outcome variable will be set to the most popular
outcome. If Nintex Workflow can determine the most popular outcome
before all assignees have completed the task, all pending tasks will be set
to 'not required’. If two or more outcomes have the same number of
responses after all tasks are completed, the 'outcome achieved' variable
will be set to 'no' and the overall outcome will be blank.

e All must agree: All assignees must agree on the same outcome. If an
assignee responds with an outcome which differs to a previous respondent,
all pending tasks will be set to 'not required’, the outcome achieved
variable will be set to 'no' and the overall task outcome will be blank.

Store outcome in
After an outcome is reached, this workflow variable will be populated with the chosen

outcome. See the 'Behaviour' section above for more detail on how outcomes are
determined.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Store outcome achieved in
In some circumstances, it is possible that an outcome is not reached. After this action is
completed, this workflow variable will be populated to indicate whether or not an

outcome has been reached. See the Behaviour section for more detail on how outcomes
are determined.

Task name

Allows the title of the task to be defined. This is the title that appears in a SharePoint task
list. If left blank, the action's title will be used by default.

References can also be inserted using the Inserting reference fields feature.

Task content type
Allows a task content type other than the default to be used. This option will only display

if an alternative content type is available on the site. Alternative content types are
primarily used to enable custom task response forms.

Priority

Specifies the value that should be assigned to the priority flag for the
task. References can also be inserted using the Inserting reference fields feature.

Due Date

Set a date for the task to be completed by. Note: When tasks appear in Nintex Mobile
Apps, the tasks list will be sorted by this due date.

Form type
Choose which form type is presented to Assignees.
Store task IDs in

When the workflow runs, the ID given to each task that is created will be stored into
an Integer, List Item ID or Collection workflow variable.

Item Permissions
Set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item.

When task is complete, set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item
after the task has been completed.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: Setting the item permissions could be useful when the task is delegated, this will
give the delegated user the necessary permissions to view the item.

Ribbon Option: Task Notification

Sent when the task is assigned to a user, also used when the task is delegated by one user

to another.

Allow delegation

When this option is selected, the assignee at runtime can delegate the task to another user.
For more information, please refer to Delegating Approval Tasks.

Allow LazyApproval

If LazyApproval has been enabled on the server, the workflow can permit the assignees
to use About LazyApproval. Lazy Approval means that an approval or rejection task
response can be registered when the assignee replies to a notification email or an
automated OCS / Lync conversation with a recognized word or phrase. An administrator
can edit or add to the list of acceptable terms. For more information, please refer to
Managing LazyApproval settings.

Delivery type

CC

Delivery type is the method of delivering the notification to the recipients.

Available delivery options; None, Email, User preference or Instant Message (if enabled
on the server). For information on User preference, please refer to Configuring user
preferences.

Please note: Nintex does not provide support for troubleshooting email, SMS or OCS /
Lync systems.

If Allow LazyApproval is checked and Delivery type selected is IM. The option Send a
conversation request to confirm if the user is available to respond will be available.
Checking this option will ask the assignee if they are available to respond, if the assignee
responds with ""No"", the Delivery type will be switched to Email and the assignee will
receive a notification email instead.

If at anytime the assignee does not respond within 5 minutes to the automated OCS /
Lync conversation, the conversation will end and a notification email to complete the
tasks will be sent instead.

The CC field sets read-only users who will receive the notification. CC recipients are not
able to respond to the tasks.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
To set the CC field click on |= to open the Select People and Groups configuration
dialog.

BCC

The BCC field sets read only users who will receive the email. BCC recipitants are not
able to respond to the tasks. Other users addressed in the email via the To, CC and BCC
fields will not be able to see any addresses in the BCC field. To set the BCC field, enter
the account name, or alternatively, select the address book icon for additional options.

From
The From field sets the user or domain group that will appear as the sender of the
message. This setting applies to emails only. If no From user or domain group is
specified, the From address configured in Global Settings will be used.

Importance
The priority of the notification. This is only applicable when using email notifications.

Subject

The Subject is the title of the notification being sent. If an Instant Message is being sent

Web Method
The web methods that are available for the web service.
Editor mode

The Editor mode defines the values to be sent to the web service. The message configuration
depends on the parameters required by the selected web service method.

e SOAP Builder: Use the SOAP Builder if the web service method only required
parameters of 'simple' data types. An input form is displayed to allow these values to be
provided. Note: If the web service method requires complex parameters, the SOAP
Builder form cannot be dispalyed and a single text box to edit the XML of the SOAP
message directly is provided.

e SOAP Editor: Use the SOAP Editor to directly edit the XML message when
the selected web service method requires only simple data types.

Note: Editing the SOAP message manually requires some advanced knowledge of web
services.

To pass the byte array of the document under workflow, type [FileData] into any input field. At
runtime Nintex Workflow will base64 encode the file and pass that as the value.

For more information on the SOAP standard please refer to http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part0.

Web service input

Options within the action

Target collection

The Target Collection parameter is required for each operation. This specifies the collection
variable that the operation applies to.

Add

Adds a new item to the collection with the value specified in the 'value’ parameter. Optionally, a
variable storing the index of what position to insert the item into the collection at can be used. If
no index variable is selected, the item will be added to the end of the collection. If the index
value is larger than the size of the collection, the workflow will error.

Remove

Removes the item stored in the collection at the specified index. This will cause the collection
size to decrease by one.

Count

Outputs a number indicating how many items are currently stored in the collection. The result is
stored in a number variable specified at Store result in.

Get
Retrieves a value at a specified index and stores the value in the variable specified at Store

result in. The output variable must be compatible with the value being retrieved from the
collection.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Exists

Outputs a Yes / No value into the variable specified at Store result in to indicate whether or not
an item matching the specified value is currently stored in the collection. The comparison is done
by comparing the text representation of the 'value' parameter with the text representation of each

item in the collection.

Sort

Sorts the values in the collection and stores the sorted collection in another collection variable
specified in Store result in. Store result in can specify the same variable as the Target
collection.

Pop

Retrieves the value at the end position of the collection and stores it in the Store result in

variable. After this operation, the retrieved item will no longer exist in the collection variable
therefore the collection will be one item shorter.

Join

Concatenates every value in the collection into a string which is stored in the Store result in
variable. Each value is separated by the specified Delimiter value.

Clear
Removes all the items from the collection.
Remove duplicates

Searches for and removes any values that exist more than once in the collection, leaving only one
instance of each value. For text values, duplicate matching is case sensitive.

Remove by value

Removes all items from the collection that equal the specified value.

For details on using Insert Reference, please refer to Inserting reference fields.

1.13 Commit pending changes

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
This workflow action forces all existing batched operations to be committed. Batched operations
are operations performed by workflow actions that do not commit immediately. For example, the
""Update list item"" action doesn’t actually update an item immediately, it waits until the
workflow commits. The workflow commits at a delay action, a task action or the end of the
workflow. So when the update list item action runs, it just registers that it needs to update the
item, the item actually updates on commit.

The SharePoint workflow engine doesn’t necessarily commit batched operations in the order
they are displayed on the designer. For example, if the following actions are in this order:

Set item permissions action (Nintex)Update list item action (Microsoft SharePoint)Set
permissions action (Nintex)

These would actually execute in this order:

e Set item permissions action (Nintex)
e Set item permissions action (Nintex)
e Update list item action (Microsoft SharePoint)

“Tt executes it in this order, because there are actually two batches, the Microsoft batch and the
Nintex batch (any other third party has their own batch). This is because third parties cannot add
operations to the Microsoft batch. In addition, all items in a single batch are executed before
actions in another batch. The batch that is executed first depends on the first activity: If the
Microsoft SharePoint action was encountered first, then all the Microsoft actions would run
before the Nintex actions.

The ""Commit pending changes"" workflow action: The ""Commit pending changes"" action is
another point where a workflow will execute all its batch operations.

So, modifying the above example:

e Set item permissions action (Nintex)

e Update list item action (Microsoft SharePoint)

e¢ Commit pending changes

e Set item permissions action (Nintex)
“Tn this case everything will run in order. The Nintex batch will run first because the Nintex
action is first encountered, but in this scenario there is only one action in this batch. The ""Update

item"" action will run. Then the workflow will commit, and the final ""Set item permissions""
action is in a new batch.

To use the workflow action:

e Locate the action in Workflow Actions Toolbox (located on the left hand-side);

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
o Click on the Category listings to reveal the actions; OR
o Search for the action using a keyword.

Options for this action

Source
The document which is to be converted. Select either:

e The Current item; OR

e Source URL. In the Source URL field, the full URL including the filename and type
will need to be provided. E.g.
‘http://mycompany.com/sales/Shared%20Documents/WordDocument.docx'

File type
The list of available file types that the source can be converted to.

e Automatic: Selecting Automatic will convert the source to the extension specified in the
Output URL. E.g. If the File type is set to Automatic and the Output URL is
‘http://mycompany.com/sales/Shared%20Documents/PDFDocument.pdf,, the item will be
converted to a PDF.

¢ Document: Specifies that the output file is an Open XML (docx) file.

¢ Document - MacroEnabled: Specifies that the output file is a macro-enabled Open
XML (docm) file.

¢ Document97: Specifies that the output file is a Word97 (doc) file.

e¢ Template: Specifies that the output file is an Open XML template (dotx) file.

e¢ Template - MacroEnabled: Specifies that the output file is a macro-enabled Open XML
template (dotm) file.

e¢ Template97: Specifies that the output file is a Word97 template (dot) file.

e MHTML: Specifies that the output file is an MHTML file.

‘http://mycompany.com/sales/Shared%20Documents/PDFDocument.PDF'

Note: The following settings will result in an unknown file type and the ""Windows can't open this
file:' dialog will appear when a user clicks on a converted document:

e Ifthe File type is Automatic and the extension is not specified in the Output URL,
the document will have no file type set.

e Ifthe File type is Automatic and the extension specified in the Output URL is not in
the available list of file types, the document will not be converted but named to correctly
with the file type.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e Ifthe File type is set and the extension specified in the Output URL is different,
the document will have both file type and extension set, the document will however be
converted to the File type set and renaming the document's extension with the File type
set will allow the user to open it.

Overwrite existing item

If the Converted document should overwrite an existing item if it already exist in the Output
URL specified. Select either:

e Overwrite: Overwrites the current document, if versioning is enabled, a new version will
be created.

e Create new version: Document will be overwritten if versioning is not enabled.

¢ Do not overwrite: Document will not be overwritten. However, the workflow will error
if the item already exists.

1.17 Convert Value

This workflow action will interpret a provided text value, and store it into a workflow variable of
a different type. For example, if a text variable contains a number, this action will store the value
as a numeric value in a number variable.

A common scenario for using this action is using it with an Inline function or the result of a
query that returns a text string that contains a number, and that number needs to be stored into a
number field of a SharePoint list. The value cannot be stored into a number field while the value
is stored in a text variable. The example in the screenshot demonstrates processing a text
variable by using an Inline function to extract the first 4 characters (maybe the variable contains
1234-XXAB). These first 4 characters will then be interpreted and stored into a number variable.

To use the workflow action:
e Locate the action in Workflow Actions Toolbox (located on the left hand-side);
o Click on the Category listings to reveal the actions; OR
o Search for the action using a keyword.
e Select the action, drag it onto the design canvas and drop it onto a design pearl.

Alternatively

e Left-clicking the pearl, mouse-over Insert Action and then the Categories to reveal the
actions, click the required action from the list.

Input

The value that is to be interpreted.

Store result in

This option specifies the variable in which the resulting value will be stored. If the input text
cannot be converted into a value that is compatible with the selected variable, the workflow will

Date format

This option only appears when the 'Store result in' variable is a date time variable. This option

Culture (Advanced)

Specify the language information (LocaleID or LCID) to use when attempting to convert the
input value into another variable type. For example, if the provided input text contained a
number in a European format, specifying a European culture identified (for example, de-DE for
German) will ensure the value is interpreted correctly. When this parameter is blank, the current
language settings of the SharePoint site will be used. This URL lists the recognized language
codes: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms912047(WinEmbedded.10).aspx. The 'Short

site. The content type of the source must match the content type of the destination - the workflow
will error if the source and destination are incompatible. To copy the library item in the
workflow to another location in SharePoint (including folders and sub-folders of the same site),
please use the ""Copy to SharePoint"" action.

To use the workflow action:
e Locate the action in Workflow Actions Toolbox (located on the left hand-side);
o Click on the Category listings to reveal the actions; OR

o Search for the action using a keyword.

Update cell values

Specifies cells that should be set in the workbook before data is retrieved. Changes to these cell
values are not committed to the workbook, they are only used to determine the values of the cells
to retrieve information.

For example, if the cell to retrieve is the sum of E2 and E4, E2 and E4 can be set in this section
and the result will be reflected in the cell to retrieve that data. Multiple cells can be updated by
clicking the Add cell to update link.

e Cell position the location of the cell to update. The cell location must be specified in the
'Al' format or be the defined name of a cell. Note that only single cells can be updated,
you cannot specify a range with multiple cells.

e Cell value the value to update the cell with.

Cells to retrieve

The range of cells to retrieve values from. A single cell must be specified in the 'A1' format. Cell
ranges must be specified in the 'A1:B2' format. If a cell or cell range is named, the defined name
can also be specified.

Store result in
The workflow variable to store the resulting value in.

If the selected variable can only contain a single value and a range is returned, only the first cell
in the range will be used.

In a collection, values are stored left to right, top to bottom. For example, if the range to return is
A1:B3, the values will be stored in this order: Al, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3.

Retrieve as formatted text

Specifies whether or not to keep the cell formatting, or only return the plain value. For example,
if a cell is formatted to display numbers as currency, selecting this option will return a string with
the currency symbol matching the display in Excel. If this option is not selected, only the
numeric value of the cell is stored.

e date values when an unformatted date value is stored into a collection, it will be stored as
a numeric representation of the date (this is how Excel Services provides the data). The
action cannot determine the difference between a number and a date represented as a
number, so the value will be treated as a number when added to the collection. When
returning a date result into a Date Time variable, the action will assume the value being
retrieved is a date and store it as such.

Approvers

The Approvers list contains all users or groups that will be assigned the approval task

during the running of the published workflow.

Users can be:

e Entered directly using their username, email address or full name and will be
resolved where possible against the SharePoint user list or Active Directory.
e Search for users, click on the address book icon on the right.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Please note that users not part of the Active Directory can be added as Approvers by
specifying their email address. However, the only way that they can respond to
the Task is through LazyApproval as they will have no access to the SharePoint site.

Select People and Groups

To search for users, click on the address book icon on the right.

3) Search for people and groups from the directory, add external email addresses or select addresses from the lookup list.

The configuration dialog allows the workflow designer to search for and/or add users to
the Approvers list by one or more of the following methods:

e Internal Search: Entering a partial display name, email or user account name and
clicking on the magnifying glass will provide a list of matching users and groups
from SharePoint as well as Active Directory

e External email address: Enter an external email address manually. Where
possible Nintex Workflow will resolve this to an actual user account.

e Lookup: Provides the option of adding a dynamic reference as an approver. e.g.
Workflow variable, list field.

Create individual tasks for all group members

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
In the case that a group is assigned the approval task and Create individual tasks for all
group members checkbox is:

e not selected, all users in that group will receive the task notification. The first
respondent will represent the entire group.
e selected, an individual task will be assigned to every group member.

Users can be entered directly by their username, email address or full name and will be
resolved where possible against the SharePoint user list. Users and groups that do not
resolve automatically with the system users will require LazyApproval to complete their
assigned task.

Allow delegation

When this option is selected the assigned approver at runtime can delegate the task to
another user. For more information, please refer to the Delegating Approval Tasks.

Allow Lazy Approval

If LazyApproval has been enabled on the server, the workflow can permit the approvers
to use LazyApproval. Lazy Approval means that an approval or rejection can be
registered when the approver replies to a notification email or an automated OCS / Lync
conversation with an approved word or phrase. A system administrator can edit or add to
the list of acceptable terms. For more information, please refer to the Managing
LazyApproval settings.

Task description

Allows entry of dynamic text that will display on the task response form. This can be
used to communicate additional information about the task to the responding user. Insert
Reference see Inserting reference fields.

Approval options

There are four options that will determine which approvals are required at runtime
in case of multiple assigned users.

e All must approve: Each user in the Approvers list must approve the item
for it to qualify as approved. If one of the users denies or rejects the item,
the item will be considered denied or rejected.

e First response applies: The first response received will be used for the
overall outcome. All other pending tasks will be set to 'not required"".

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e Only one approval is required: The task will be deemed as approved as
soon as one approval response is accepted. All other approval requests will
subsequently no longer be required.

e Vote: The number of approvals from users required for the document to
be considered approved can be set using the ""Vote"" option. A text field
will appear and a whole number equal to or less than the total number of
approvers set in the Approvers section can be entered.

Task name

Allows the title of the task to be defined. This is the title that appears in a SharePoint task
list. If left blank, the action title will be used by default.

Task content type
Allows a task content type other than the default to be used. This option will only display
if an alternative content type is available on the site. Alternative content types are
primarily used to enable custom task response forms.

Priority
Specifies the value that should be assigned to the priority flag for the task.

Due Date

Set a date for the task to be completed by. Note: When tasks appear in Nintex Mobile
Apps, the tasks list will be sorted by this due date.

Form type
Choose which form type is presented to Approvers.

Store action ID in
Allows a unique identifier for the action to be stored in an Action ID workflow variable.
This identifier can be used to link the action to Delegate Task and Task reminder actions.

Please note that the Action ID does not correspond to the ID of the SharePoint task item
that is created.

Store task IDs in

When the workflow runs, the ID given to each task that is created will be stored into an
Integer, List Item ID or Collection workflow variable.

Item Permissions

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item.

When task is complete, set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item

after the task has been completed.

Note: Setting the item permissions could be useful when the task is delegated, this will
give the delegated user the necessary permissions to view the item.

Ribbon Option: Task Notification

Sent when the task is assigned to a user, also used when the task is delegated by one user

to another.

group. If it is assigned to a group, the first group member to respond will act on behalf of
the entire group.

Note: Although the People Picker field will allow multiple users to be added, the first
person added will be the only person notified and the only person who can approve the
task. If a group is added, all will receive the notification, but only one person will be able

e Internal Search: Entering a partial display name, email or user account name and

clicking on the magnifying glass will provide a list of matching users and groups
from SharePoint as well as Active Directory.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e External email address: Enter an external email address manually. Where
possible Nintex Workflow will resolve this to an actual user account.

e Lookup: Provides the option of adding a dynamic reference as an approver. e.g.
Workflow variable, list field.

Click the title bar to expand or collapse each option.

Content type

When the action runs, it creates a task for the user to complete. Each data item is created
as a field in a task content type, and this content type is used when creating a task.

An existing content type can be used, or a new content type constructed. The list of
existing content types will show all content types that inherit from the 'Workflow Task'
content type. The new content type will also inherit from this parent. See the SharePoint
documentation for more information on content types.

If an existing content type is chosen, the option will appear to make changes to the
content type. This can include removing, adding or modifying existing fields. This option
should be used with caution, as changes may affect other workflows or applications that
use the content type.

A content type is only created or modified when the workflow is published, not when it is

saved. If you define a new content type, then save the workflow, your changes will be
lost when you next edit the workflow.

Field list

In this panel the data items to request from the user are defined. Each represents a field in
the selected Content Type.

Each field has the option to store the value in a workflow variable. This will enable the
value to be used directly in the workflow without it having to be looked up manually with
a Set Variable action.

Further options for each field can be set from the SharePoint Content Type settings page.

The content type is only updated when the workflow is published.

Publish task edit form

When the workflow is published, it will generate a form for the task. This form is
associated with the task content type and will overwrite an existing form if it exists. This
option allows the designer to specify whether to publish the form or not when the content
type already exists. If other applications use the form, or the form has been customised,
the designer may not want to republish it so the changes are not lost.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Only show fields with variables assigned
When this option is selected, only data fields that have a variable selected for 'Store
Result In' will have a visible input field on the published form. If this option is not
selected, all the data items displayed in the field list will have input fields on the form.
The generated form is a standard list item edit page and can be customized in SharePoint
Designer. The form is stored in the Workflows/Nintex Workflows/workflowname folder

and will be named the same as the content type.

Note that the form is only published when the workflow is published.

Display link to workflow item on the task form
When this option is selected, the published task form will have a field called 'Link'

containing a hyperlink back to the item that the workflow is running on. This is used to
provide context about the workflow item for the user responding to the task.

Display the item properties panel on the task form
When this option is selected, the default SharePoint task form will display a panel with

the field names and values of the item that the workflow is running on. This option does
not affect the task form published by Nintex.

Allow attachments
When this option is selected, the published task form will display a link to add

attachments to the task item. The task respondent will then have the opportunity to
optionally attach one or more files to the form.

Store attachment URLs in
This option allows the selection of a collection workflow variable in which to store

the URL of each attachment that the task respondent added to the task. This option is
only available if Allow attachments is enabled, or if Publish task form is disabled.

Task description

On the default task edit page, this text will appear at the top of the page before the input
controls. It is stored in the task's description field.

Allow delegation

When this option is selected, the user whom the task was assigned to will have the option
to reassign it to another user.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Enable responses by email using LazyApproval
When this option is selected, the user can complete the task by replying to the notification
email. The email will contain a basic form, providing a location for the user to enter each
requested value. By default, the form is appended to the message body. To control the
location of the form, use the following token in the Input Required message:
{LAZY APPROVAL DATA FORM}
Note: the email form only shows fields that have variables assigned.
For more information see the About LazyApproval help topic.

Task name
The title that will be assigned to the task.

Priority
Specifies the value that should be assigned to the priority flag for the task.

Due Date

Set a date for the task to be completed by. Note: When tasks appear in Nintex Mobile
Apps, the tasks list will be sorted by this due date.

Store action ID in
Action IDs are used to link a task action to other actions in the workflow that are task

related, such as the Task Reminder. Select an Action ID workflow variable to link this
task to another action.

Store task ID in
This will store the SharePoint list item ID of the created task into an integer workflow
variable. This value can then be used to reference the task list item directly in workflow
lookups.

Item Permissions

Set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item.

When task is complete, set user permissions to: Sets the user permission on the item
after the task has been completed.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: Setting the item permissions could be useful when the task is delegated, this will
give the delegated user the necessary permissions to view the item.

Form type

Select the Default form or an InfoPath form.

Ribbon Option: Task Notification

Sent when the task is assigned to a user, also used when the task is delegated by one user to

another.

¢ Check list item permissions

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
This condition checks if the permissions of a specified user matches or is higher than the
specified permission level provided for an item in a list. It does not check that the users
have specific permission levels. A user can be a single user, multiple users or a group.
For the condition to evaluate as true, the user/s must have at least the permissions that the
permission levels provide.

¢ Check list item permissions levels

This condition checks if permission levels of a specified user matches or is higher than
the permission levels for an item within this list. A user can be a single user or multiple
users but cannot be a group for this condition. For the condition to evaluate as true, the
users must have the permission levels specified in the condition.

There are many operators that can be used within this condition, e.g. equals, not equals to,

greater than, less than, is empty, contains etc. Enter data manually into the text box or

use lookups to dynamically build the values at run time.

Add Conditions

Multiple conditions can be constructed by using the Add condition option.

Specify And or Or between the condition statements.

When there are multiple conditions, they are evaluated bottom to top. For example, the last two

conditions will be evaluated, then that result evaluated against the next condition. That pattern
will continue until a final result is reached.

Specifies whether the workflow is only sending a message to BizTalk, waiting for a message to
arrive from BizTalk or both.

Message ID

A unique identifier that is used by Nintex Workflow when the BizTalk message handler receives
a message. Nintex Workflow uses this value to determine for which workflow a message is
intended.

This option allows the current workflow item to be sent to BizTalk, instead of defining

individual data from the workflow. If this option is used, the schema must be provided by the
user.

Data to send

Allows selection of the data that must make up the message to send to BizTalk. Each data item
will be presented as an element in the resulting message.

Options within the action

Set permission on

Select either the Current item that the workflow is running on, or one of the available lists or
libraries.

If selecting a library list or library location, the Where selector will appear.
Inherit permissions from parent
This drop-down is used to break the link to the parent permission set (the permissions used in the

library or list that contains the item in workflow). Once the option No is selected, specific
permissions for specific users can be set.

Remove Existing Permissions

This option specifies whether or not to clear the permissions that are currently set on the item
before adding the new permissions defined in the action. When selected, permissions that are
defined in the action will be the only resulting permissions on the item. When it is not selected,
permissions that are defined in this action will be added to the current permissions. If the item

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
currently inherits its permissions from the parent list when the action runs, unselecting this
option will cause the inherited permissions to be copied to the item.

User(s)

Select a user or group to assign access permissions for the item.

Permission

The level of permission that can be assigned to a user or group for the item. Unless Remove
existing permissions is selected, the permission will be added to the user's existing rights.
Choose the Remove option in the drop down list to remove all permissions from a user or group.
Permissions are processed in the order that they are configured, therefore permissions can be
cleared from a user in the first panel, then a new permission level can be set for the same user in
the second panel.

Add user permission

Click this link to add more users or groups to apply permissions to.

Note: if the Initiating user of the workflow does not have read permissions, the workflow may

error. This is because the workflow is running as the user and requires the ability to read the list
item.

Troubleshooting

Action not executing

The work load for this action is added to a job queue. The workflow executes jobs in the queue
as a batch when it reaches a ""commit"" point. For more information, see the Nintex article

Workflow to Start

From the drop-down that is presented, choose the title of a workflow to start. In lists or libraries,
only published site workflows in the same site or published workflows in the list or library in
which the current workflow is operating will be available. When designing a site workflow, only
other published site workflows will be available.

If the workflow was created with Nintex Workflow and has start data specified, a form will be
displayed to provide values. For a workflow that is provided out of the box, or installed as a

Feature, a panel will be provided to edit the association xml.

Set the Start mode with one of the following:

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e Start immediately: Specifies that the target workflow will start when this executes.

o Wait for the workflow to complete before continuing: When this option is
checked, the current workflow will only run when the specified workflow has
completed.

o Do not start this workflow if it is already running: When this option is
checked, the current workflow will not run the specified workflow if it is in
progress.

o Store Instance ID in: Select a workflow variable in which to store the workflow
instance ID. The value in the workflow variable can then be used elsewhere in the
workflow.

e Schedule: Creates a new workflow schedule for the target workflow. The target
workflow will then execute based on the schedule. For more information on workflow
schedules see the Scheduling a workflow help page.

Schedule Editor mode
When using the Schedule start mode, select one of the following schedule editor modes:
e Schedule Builder: Set the schedule settings for the workflow.
e Schedule XML: This is the format in which the schedule is stored and can be edited
directly.
Note: When a date is typed in, it must be in the ISO8601 format.
Sharing data between workflows
The Store data and Retrieve data workflow actions can be used to transfer values between
workflow instances. A workflow that is started by the Start workflow action can store a value

with the Store data action, and the parent workflow can later retrieve that value with the
Retrieve data action and the value stored from the Store Instance ID in option.

1.89 State Machine

This workflow action provides a construct to define a number of states that the workflow can be
in. Each state contains actions that will execute when the workflow is in that state. The workflow
moves between states until it is instructed to end the state machine.

Action Settings

Select a state from the drop-down to determine which will be used first when the workflow is

States

The State Machine supports the configuration of a number of states. States can be added,
deleted and renamed. Deleting a state will delete all actions currently added to it.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
The State Machine uses Change State actions to set which state to run next. For example, the
actions in a state will repeat until a Change State action is used to set a different state. Workflow
execution does not move to the next state instantly when the Change State action is run, it will
only move to the next state once all actions in the current state have completed executing.

The following example image shows the 'Change State' actions in a State Machine. A 'Change
State' action can set the next state to be any of the others available in the state machine. The
states can be made to run in any order and conditions in one state can cause another state to be
re-run. The State Machine part of the workflow will continue until the state has been set to 'End
State Machine’ in one of the 'Change State' actions. If there are other workflow actions below the
State Machine, they will execute once the State Machine has completed.

State 3 End State Machine

State 2

The ""Change State"" action does not instantly change execution to the new state, it only sets
which state should be run next. Selecting ‘End State Machine’ will exit the State Machine
construct when the current state has finished running. Essentially, it always will occur at the end
of all the actions in the step.

Nintex Workflow state machine construct is very different from a Visual Studio created State
Machine. Nintex workflows' are Windows Workflow Foundation sequential workflows. Nintex
made the ‘state machine’ by wrapping up loops, parallel branches, if statements and variables to
control it. It’s not a real state machine, but rather a construct to provide the ability to jump
around between steps and mimic some of the scenarios that a state machine might be used for.

-NET 3.0 workflows come in 2 varieties. Sequential (like a flow chart) and state

machines. With SharePoint declarative workflows (like the ones Nintex Workflow designs),
these can only be sequential. To achieve the effect of a state machine in a sequential workflow,
under the covers there is some clever logic made up of a while loop, parallel actions and various
conditions.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
With each iteration of the loop, a common workflow variable, used to store the current state, is
evaluated to see if it should exit. Otherwise, it begins down each branch of the parallel

action. At the top of each branch (state) is a condition to determine if the workflow should
process actions in this branch. (if state = current state) The change state action sets the value of
the current state workflow variable. Upon the next iteration of the loop, this determines which
branch (state) to execute.

Each 'state' may have complex logic within it to determine the next. Using the 'wait for item
update' action, or 'request approval’, will ensure the state machine wait on user input before
deciding which state to process next.

For 'states' that transitioned based on mutually exclusive inputs, it may be better off having
several workflows that run when the item is modified. At the start of each workflow, use the
filter action to check if the input conditions are met. If it is not, the workflow will end. In this
scenario, each workflow essentially becomes a state.

For information on safeguarding performance by preventing excessive looping iterations, see
Preventing excessive looping iterations.

1.90 Store data

This workflow action can be used to store data which can then be retrieved using the Retrieve
data workflow action. Using both the Store data and Retrieve data workflow actions, it provides
the ability to pass workflow variables (values) between workflow instances (running workflows).

To use the workflow action:
e Locate the action in Workflow Actions Toolbox (located on the left hand-side);
o Click on the Category listings to reveal the actions; OR
o Search for the action using a keyword.
e Select the action, drag it onto the design canvas and drop it onto a design pearl.

the three most recent rating and comments that have been made for the service. The View all
ratings and comments displays all the ratings and comments of the service,

including any ratings and comments made about the previous version(s) of the service.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
When posting a rating and comment, the user's domain username will be displayed with the
rating and comments made when it is viewed by users within the organization. The option to put
an Alias will be available if ratings and comments have been set to all Nintex Live users
(includes users outside the organization).

To post a rating and comment for a service:
Click on the Rate and comment link for the service.

e Rating: The rating for the service. A rating of at least 1 star must be selected.

e Comments: Comments about the service. To comment, the service must be rated.

(includes users outside the organization).

A user can only make a rating and comment once. By rating and commenting on the service
again, the previous rating and comments that was made will be displayed and the user will be
able to modify them.

3 Workflow Interaction with SharePoint

3.1 About LazyApproval

The LazyApproval feature of Nintex Workflow enables approvals or rejections of an item to be
registered when the approver replies to the notification email or respond to the automated OCS
or Lync conversation with a permitted word or phrase. That word or phrase is recognized and
interpreted by the system and applied to the item in the workflow.

LazyApproval is not automatically enabled at the time of installation, it has to be manually
enabled. For more information, please refer to the Managing LazyApproval settings.

The LazyApproval feature is only available with the Request Approval, Request Data, Request
Review and Assign Flexi Task workflow actions.

There are two LazyApproval methods that can be enabled for Nintex Workflow:

e LazyApproval via email: Workflow tasks actions can be configured to accept responses
from users via an email reply.

e LazyApproval via OCS / Lync:Workflow task actions can be configured to accept
responses via an automated OCS or Lync conversation.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Not all workflow actions support both methods. LazyApproval via email is supported by the
workflow actions that have been mentioned above. LazyApproval via OCS / Lync is only
supported by the Request Approval, Request Review and Assign Flexi Task workflow actions.

At the time of configuring the workflow action, the designer needs to check the box ""Allow
LazyApproval"".

When LazyApproval via email is used, an addition to the standard email template footer is
added that explains how to use LazyApproval. When the system receives the return email it will
scan the first 20 lines of the reply for a recognized LazyApproval term. It scans from the top of
an email downwards and uses the first recognized term it finds that is an exact match for a
permitted whole word or whole phrase on a line by itself. Recognized words or phrases that
appear with unrecognized words or phrases on the same line will be ignored and skipped.

You can customize the footer text from the Managing LazyApproval settings in Central
Administration.

If a term is not found, a return email will be sent to the user informing him/her that their response
was not able to be interpreted. The user can then reply to that email with a recognized term for
the 'approve' or 'deny' to take effect.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When LazyApproval emails are sent, a specific piece of identification
code is appended to the email subject. Do not edit or remove the identification code as any
change to it will mean that the LazyApproval thread cannot be traced and approval by email will
not be possible for the user involved. That user will have to approve the item by navigating
through the SharePoint library or list where the item and workflow are being used. For more
information, please refer to the Approving, Rejecting and Reviewing Items.

A system administrator can edit or add to the list of acceptable and recognized terms. For more
information, please refer to the Managing LazyApproval settings. LazyApproval terms are not
case sensitive. The default set of terms is: ""approve"", ""approved"", ""decline"", ""declined"", ""no"",
""ok"", ""reject"", ""rejected"" and ""yes"" as seen below:

3.2 Approving, Rejecting and Reviewing Items

During runtime, when a user interaction task is created as part of a workflow, tasks will be
assigned and the notification message(s) sent. The task(s) assigned to a user can be seen at any
time via the My Workflow Tasks web part or the Nintex workflow task list setup within the site.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
To process an assigned task, click the item's hyperlink (if configured and allowed) within the
notification email or on the hyperlink within the Item column of the My Workflow Tasks web
part web part. This will open the 'Approve Reject' page ready for the user's response.

The 'Approve Reject' page

Status

When a task is generated by the ""Request approval’ action, the user can choose to approve or
reject the item in the workflow. The selection made will determine the path followed by the

workflow.

When a task is generated by the 'Request review' action, there is no response to process as the
item is deemed satisfactory when the user is finished with it.

Depending on the configured workflow action, the user may be given the option of Delegating
Approval Tasks the task to another user.

Comment

Use this field to enter any comments about why the item was approved or rejected.

Item Properties

Listed in the Item Properties section is the meta data related to the item in the workflow. To view
the full details of the item click the hyperlink next to the Item property heading. Similarly, to
view the status of the workflow graphically, click on the View link provided.

The Item Properties panel also displays the field values of the item the workflow is running on
(not shown in this screenshot). You can determine which fields are displayed by creating a view

called 'Workflow Task View'. The name of the view to use is configurable in the Global
settings in SharePoint Central Administration.

Note: Task delegations done through Task Delegation feature are only used when a task is
initially assigned to a user. If a task is reassigned via the 'Delegate workflow task' action, or by
another user manually, the task will be assigned to the specified user, even if they have long term
delegations defined.

3.6 InfoPath Forms

The Nintex Workflow InfoPath Forms feature allows workflow designers to edit start and task
forms using Microsoft InfoPath 2013.

InfoPath forms can be defined for the following:

Start form
Request data
Assign Flexi task
Request approval
Request review

Server requirements

The server must have Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 installed (not just SharePoint
Foundation 2013).
Clients must have Microsoft InfoPath 2013 installed.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Assigning Form type

Nintex Workflow supports the use of either the Default form (which is an .aspx form provided
out of the box and is not editable by end users), an InfoPath form (which is editable in Microsoft
InfoPath 2013) and Custom (pre-developed .aspx) forms.

To assign the form type:

e Open the action dialog (for start forms open from the Workflow Settings dialog).
e Select the Form type.

e Click Save

Edit a Microsoft InfoPath 2013 form

e Open the action dialog (for start forms, open from the Workflow Settings dialog).
e Click Edit Task Form or Edit Start Form button, then select Edit with Microsoft
InfoPath 2013.

e Microsoft InfoPath 2013 will open.

e Edit the form as required.

e To save the changes, click Quick Publish (Ctrl+Shift+Q).

e The Save As dialog box will appear. InfoPath requires you to save the form to local
location before it can publish it to SharePoint. Save the form to a local location -""Temp""
can be used. The file saved to this location will then save the changes back
to SharePoint/Nintex Workflow and not required to be used again, i.e. the next time the
form is edited, a new instance in InfoPath is created.

e Once the publish back to Nintex Workflow has completed, the ""published successfully""
message will appear.

e Close InfoPath.
The Form type will be automatically changed to InfoPath.
e The changes will take effect once the workflow is published.

Shared forms

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
When a workflow action using InfoPath is copied and pasted, the form will be shared by both
actions by default.

e Prior to editing the form in InfoPath, Nintex Workflow will confirm if the form is to
remain a shared form or a separate instance of the form should be created.

e Clicking OK will create a copy of the shared form. Changes to the form from this point
onwards will apply only to this action. The original form will not be modified.
e Clicking Cancel will edit the shared form. Changes will affect this action and all other
actions using this form.
Important note
Nintex Workflow will automatically attempt to update fields in the InfoPath form when
the action configuration changes. However, if the Cancel button within the form is modified, the
form fields will no longer update automatically but can still be added manually in InfoPath.
Data context (Advanced)
The InfoPath forms contain a data source called NWContext which provides additional
information relevant to the current item, list and user permissions. A developer or designer can
use this information to extend the functionality of the form.

To access the data source:

o Click Show advanced view.

o Change the Fields dropdown to NWContext.

o A list of available context fields will be displayed.

These fields can be used to extend the functionality of the form. Some examples are:
o Call a Nintex Workflow web service to delegate a task.

o Show additional information to a site administrator.
o Display information about the item the task is for.

The Manage workflow history lists provides the ability to create new SharePoint workflow
history lists and enable existing SharePoint workflow history lists for use with Nintex Workflow

within a team site.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
A SharePoint workflow history list stores messages generated by a workflow. Everything from
approval activity (approve/reject), updates to a workflow, comments, cancellations and even
workflow errors.

By default Nintex Workflow creates a SharePoint workflow history list that is enabled for Nintex
Workflow. The enablement deploys event receivers into the list for workflow

reporting. The standard SharePoint workflow history list cannot be used with workflows

in Nintex. To use a standard SharePoint workflow history list it must first be enabled for Nintex
Workflow.

To manage the history lists for use with Nintex Workflow:

e Navigate to the site level homepage.

e Click on the Settings Icon bd , and then click on Site Settings.
e Inthe Nintex Workflow group, click on Manage workflow history lists.

the other two states. For example, if the status indicator interval is set at 8 hours
then the red indicator will be displayed 8 hours before the 'Expected duration! is
reached, the orange indicator will be displayed 8 hours before the red indicator

is displayed and all time before that, the status indicator will be 'New'.

> Regional settings' section. Public holidays and any other special occasions are set using
the 'Site Settings > Nintex Workflow > Manage Holidays' page.

o Schedule End: The end of the scheduling cycle. Either set a specific end date and
time or by defining the number of times the workflow should run or set it to run
indefinitely.

o When all settings are configured, click on the Save button. The scheduled

To associate a reusable workflow template:

e Save the reusable workflow template: the Set Title & Description dialog will appear.
e Inthe Set Title & Description dialog the following options are available:
o Name: The name of the workflow when listed in the SharePoint Workflow
Settings page.
o Description: The description of the workflow when listed in the SharePoint

o Content Type: Select the Content Type that this reusable workflow template will
be associated with. When selecting a specific content type, take note of the
following:

Associating it with a parent content type will make the reusable workflow
template available to the child content types of the parent.

Selecting a content type, will only allow fields that are associated to that
content type to be available when configuring workflow actions.

Best practice: To prevent lengthy content type evaluation when saving or
publishing reusable workflow templates, avoid selecting “All” or “Item”
for the content type. Instead, create a content type based on Item and then
select the created content type when defining the reusable workflow
template.

3.13 Site Workflows

A Site Workflow is a workflow that is not attached to a list or library but rather to a site itself.

The creation and management of site workflows is the same as for workflows that are attached to

a list or library.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: When creating a site workflow in the Nintex Workflow Designer, some actions which are
list and library specific will not be available.

3.14 Starting a workflow

There are three options to start a workflow. How the workflow starts is dependent on how the
workflow is configured.

Following are the various ways to start a workflow:

e §=©Start manually: When this setting is checked for a workflow, the user has the option to start the
workflow manually. This help page will explain how to start a workflow manually.

e Start when items are created: When a library or list item is created or uploaded, all
workflows in the library or list with this option enabled will start.

e Start when items are modified: When a library or list item is modified, all workflows in
the library or list with this option enabled will start. Conditions can be set to start the
workflow when a specific column is modified. Refer to Workflow Settings.

Note: For list and library workflows, folders and sub-folders are subject to the same workflows
as the parent library. Therefore, if you set a workflow to start when items are created or
modified, any item, regardless of how many folders or sub-folders the item is stored within,

it will trigger all the workflows that are set to start automatically. That behavior is governed by
SharePoint.”

Starting a workflow manually

To start a workflow manually:

For List/Library Workflows

e Navigate to the list or library that contains the item that the workflow is to be started on.
e Click on the item context menu ="", and the dots again to activate the menu. Then click
Workflows.

3.15 Updating User Defined Action in Published Workflows

Published workflows that use a User Defined Action must be republished whenever a change is
made to the instance of the UDA. Until the published workflow is republished, it will continue to
reflect the last published version of the UDA when it was used and published in the workflow.

When republishing a UDA, an option is available to analyze the UDA (Analyze UDA
function) to show all instances of the UDA in published workflows and republish the workflows.

To update all instances of the UDA in published workflows through the workflow designer:

e In the workflow designer, click on Publish.

3.18 User Defined Actions

User Defined Actions (UDA) provides the ability to string together a predefined set of multiple
workflow actions for workflow designers to use when creating a workflow. The UDA feature is
similar to using workflow snippets, however a UDA will allow for Input and Output parameters
to be defined which can then be used as a single action within a workflow.

An example of when a UDA might be useful is preconfiguring a web request workflow action
and saving it as a UDA which a workflow designer can then drag and drop into their workflow
without having to configure any of the settings within the web request workflow action. In
addition to that, an input parameter can be defined for a user to provide their credentials for the
web request and the output parameter for any values that might be returned by the web request.

Note: Only Site Administrators, Site Collection Administrators and Farm Administrators can
manage User Defined Actions.

Managing User Defined Actions

A UDA can be defined globally for the farm in SharePoint Central Administration, for a specific
site collection or for individual sites.

Note: UDAs must be initially created at a Site level. They can then be used at the:

e Site Collection Level by Promoting the UDA, OR;
e Web Farm level by Exporting and Importing the UDA.

Things to note when using UDAs:

e For UDAs that have been modified but are currently in use in a workflow, the new
settings of the UDA will only be in place once the workflow using the UDA is
republished.

e AUDA containing a disallowed action will still run, but can only be imported if the user
importing has rights to use all the workflow actions in the UDA.

e AUDA has a unique GUID ID. When importing a UDA, if the UDA has the same name
but a different unique GUID ID, the UDA can be imported, however if the UDA has been
renamed and an existing UDA with the same GUID ID exists, the user will be presented
with options to overwrite or create anew UDA.

4.4 Preventing excessive looping iterations

Excessive looping iterations can occur when a loop is configured to run for many iterations
without a pause or when the environment, variables, or business logic conditions cause
workflows to iterate through actions indefinitely (or for a great number of times). This
occurrence can reduce performance and starve other workflows of resources.

The following farm-wide settings are available to help prevent excessive looping iterations and
thus safeguard performance.

e Enforce safe looping (enabled by default): Automatically adds a hidden delay at the end
of each iteration of a loop action (Loop only) if the child actions are not guaranteed to
cause the workflow to stop and wait. This delay can cause a 2- to 7-minute pause
between each run of the loop. Delays are added when the workflow is published; to see
the change in behavior, republish existing workflows that use loop actions.

e Enable maximum loop threshold (enabled by default with a threshold of 250): Traps
excessive iterations, stopping workflow instances containing loop actions (Loop or State
Machine) that iterate beyond the specified threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, an error
is logged to the workflow history.

As administrator, you can change the above settings from Global Settings in Central
Administration.

4.6 Licensing settings

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Nintex Workflow uses a license file (.nlf) for server licensing. A single license file is used to
store information about all servers in your organisation that are licensed for Nintex Workflow.

Nintex Licensing Options

Nintex Workflow 2013 is available in three editions — Workgroup, Standard and Enterprise.

Nintex Workflow 2013 — Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition

A license is required for each SharePoint front-end server where user interaction with Nintex
Workflow 2013 components occurs.

Please contact our sales team if you need advice at sales@nintex.com.

Nintex Workflow 2013 — Workgroup Edition
This license covers a single SharePoint front-end server environment with up to five team sites.
Only one Workgroup Edition license can be purchased. If more than five site activations or

multiple front-end servers are required, a Standard or Enterprise Edition license is required.

Note: Administrators are able to manage which sites Nintex Workflow has been activated on and
deactivate Nintex Workflow on sites that no longer require Nintex Workflow functionality.

Please contact our sales team if you need advice at sales@nintex.com.

Software Assurance

Valid Software Assurance is required in order to update to the latest version of Nintex
Workflow.

4.7 Database settings

The Database setup allows an Administrator to configure and manage the Nintex Workflow
database settings.

To configure and manage the Nintex Workflow database settings:

e Navigate to the SharePoint Central Administration.
e Inthe Quick Launch, click on Nintex Workflow Management, click on Database setup.

Nintex Workflow Management
“S| Licensing | Database setup | Web Application activation | Manage allowed actions | Global settings

LazyApproval settings | Message templates | Manage workflow constants | Manage user defined actions

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e These settings need to be configured second after the licensing but prior to other settings
to allow Nintex to store its configuration settings.

Configuration Database

Each Nintex Workflow installation requires that one configuration database be specified to store
the server specific configuration settings required for running the application.

There are essentially two options here, firstly a new database can be created by Nintex
Workflow, or alternatively an existing database can be used by marking the Connect to existing
database check box. For either option, the properties of the connection string need to be
configured. These being the name of the SQL Server database server, the name of the database
and the authentication settings.

Nintex Workflow Management » Nintex Workflow Database Setup » Change configuration database

To change the Configuration Database:
e On the Nintex Workflow Database Setup page, click on the Edit button.
e Make the changes required.
e When all settings are configured, click the OK button.

Content Databases

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
At runtime each workflow requires a content database. Hence at minimum, Nintex
Workflow requires at least one content database to be configured.

Again there are essentially two options here, firstly a new database can be created by Nintex, or
alternatively an existing database can be used by marking the Connect to existing database
check box. For either option, the properties of the connection string need to be configured. These
being the name of the SQL Server database server, the name of the database and the
authentication settings.

Note: By adding multiple content databases, Nintex Workflow can automatically distribute the
workflows within each site collection to their separate content databases to help spread the load.
In small farm scenarios it is reasonable to use the same database for the content and
configuration databases.

KNOWN ISSUE

Title Error establishing connection to SQL Server

‘An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the
server. When connecting to SQL Server, this failure may be
caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server
does not allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes
Provider, error:40 - Could not open a connection to SQL
server)'.

Problem

If you receive the abovementioned error or something very
similar and the default Server name in the Add Configuration
Database page is:
""LOCALSERVERNAME\Microsoft##SSEE"", then here is
some information.

When the user has installed SharePoint as standalone and not
connected to any existing install of SQL Server, an embedded
instance is used called Microsoft##SSEE. This instance is
locked down to other applications.

Resolution

To install Nintex Workflow 2013, an additional database
instance must be installed. This can be SQL Server Express
2008, which is free and available from:
http://www.microsoft.com/

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
It can coexist on the same server as SharePoint.

The Nintex Workflow configuration pages must then be
changed to point to this new database.

4.8 Manage content databases

Add content database

The add content database page is used to configure and setup additional content databases for
Nintex Workflow. Nintex Workflow supports the use of multiple content databases. All data
generated from a particular site collection is stored within a single content database. By default,
when a workflow is first run on a site collection, a content database is selected automatically
based on how many site collections it already contains.

To add a new content database:

e Inthe Content Databases section, click Add content database.

e Inthe Database Server text box, enter the name of your database server. (Note: it defaults
to the default SharePoint database server).

e Inthe Database Name text box, enter a name for the database.

e Click OK.

View database mappings

The view database mappings page is used to determine which workflow content database stores
the data for a particular site collection. The page lists all site collections and their corresponding
database.

Manage database mappings

The manage database mappings page allows selection of which workflow content database to use
when the site collection Feature is activated on a new site collection. This is done per SharePoint
content database, so all site collections held within a particular SharePoint content database will
use the specified workflow content database. Site collections that already have the workflow
Feature activated will not be affected by changes in these settings.

To change a database mapping:
e Inthe Content Databases section, click Manage database mappings.
e¢ To map a SharePoint Content Database select the desired database in the Map to

Workflow Content Database drop-down.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
e Click OK.

4.9 Web Application activation settings

The Web Application Activation page provides the option to activate the Nintex Workflow
solution to the web farm. These settings must to be configured after importing the Nintex
Workflow license and configuring the database settings.

To activate Nintex Workflow on web farm:
e Navigate to SharePoint Central Administration.

e Inthe Quick Launch, click on Nintex Workflow Management click on Web
Application activation.

Nintex Workflow Management
“S| Licensing | Database setup | Web Application activation | Manage allowed actions | Global settings

LazyApproval settings | Message templates | Manage workflow constants | Manage user defined actions
Manage context data | Manage holidays | Manage workflow reports | Administration reports
Workflow error notifications | Purge workflow data | Live settings | Live catalog settings | Live access management

e The default web application name should be chosen automatically - if not, select it using
the drop-down, then click the Activate button.

Note: By checking All content web applications, Nintex Workflow will be activated
across the web farm.

Iintex Workflow Management » Web Application Activation

It is now best to configure the email-related Global Settings.

4.10 Managing workflow actions
This page is used to manage the Nintex Workflow actions that are available to workflow

Enforce allowed actions at run time

The Enforce allowed actions at run time option is available in the Global Settings from

the Nintex Workflow Management section in Central Administration. When this option is
enabled, a workflow that contains an action that is not marked as Allowed will cause the
workflow to error. However, not all actions are affected by this option. Actions that don't apply
to this option are actions that are native within Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013.

4.11 Global Settings

The Global Settings page is used to set Nintex Workflow settings including email, verbose
logging, allowed actions, and other application options for the web farm.

4.12 Managing LazyApproval settings

This page is used to manage the LazyApproval feature of Nintex Workflow. It provides the
options to edit the current list of recognized terms or add others, edit the LazyApproval
notification footer and set phrases to ignore. LazyApproval must first be enabled for the system.
Please refer to the About LazyApproval for more information.

Enabling / Disabling Lazy Approval

There are two LazyApproval methods that can be enabled for Nintex Workflow:

e LazyApproval via email: Workflow task actions can be configured to accept responses
from users via an email reply.

4.16 Security Settings

According to how a user is required to interact with Nintex Workflow there are different security
considerations to be made. The table below outlines the minimum permissions required to
perform the actions described. In general, the runtime permissions can be inherited from the site
or the parent site but must be the effective permissions for the given user at the list level.

Configuring Allowed Workflow Designers

There is a known permissions quirk with SharePoint 2013 workflows created using either Nintex
Workflow or SharePoint Designer (SPD).

A Workflows list is used to hold all defined workflows for a team site. Upon creating your first
workflow in SPD or activating the ""Nintex Workflow 2013"" feature, this list is given unique
permissions, which copies the current permissions assigned within the site. As a result, the only
people who will be able to modify permissions on this list are site owners or those who were
given explicit 'Full Control' access before the list was created.

Nintex have exposed the list through the user interface to work around the permission quirk
described. To add/remove users as designers, the user assigning the permissions must be a site
owner or have Full Control access to the Workflows list.

To add a user or group to the Workflow designers group:

e Navigate to the site.

e In the Settings Icon & , found on the top right-hand side, click on Site Settings.
e Inthe Nintex Workflow group, click the link Allowed workflow designers.

5.1 Getting started with the Nintex Workflow designer

Getting started with the Nintex Workflow designer.

Creating a workflow
A workflow can be created in one of two ways.
To create a new workflow from within a Document Library:
1. Select the Library tab on the Ribbon.
2. Click the Workflow Settings button and select Create a Workflow in Nintex

Workflow from the menu options.

To create a new workflow from the Workflow Gallery:

The Nintex Workflow designer will open in the current window.

The Nintex Workflow Designer

The Nintex Workflow designer page has three main areas; the Workflow Actions toolbox on
the left, the Ribbon at the top and the design canvas in the center.

The Workflow Actions toolbox

The Workflow Actions toolbox lists the actions that can be used in the design canvas to create
workflows. The actions are divided into groups of related actions. Click the heading of a group to
view the actions in that group. The default groupings are:

« Commonly used

e Integration

e Libraries and lists

e Logic and flow

e Operations

e Provisioning

e User Defined Actions (shown only if the User Defined Actions have been created)
e User interaction

e My snippets (shown only if snippets have been created)

The names of workflow actions and the groupings can be edited by the Administrator. For more
information please refer to the Managing workflow actions.

Resizing the Actions toolbox

To resize the toolbox: Click and drag on the expander bar on the inside edge of the toolbox.

Adding actions to the design canvas

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
To design a workflow, add the desired actions onto the design canvas and configure each action.
An action can be placed onto the design canvas by one of two methods:

e Left-click and drag an action from the Actions toolbox and drop it onto a drop zone
~ on the design canvas; OR
e Right-click on a drop zone on the design canvas, click Insert Action and select the

required action from the list.
Configuring actions
To configure an action, select the drop-down menu in the title bar of the workflow action once it
is on the design canvas.
Configure: Open the action settings dialog to configure the settings of an action.
Copy: Select to copy an action (includes all its configuration settings) and paste in to another
location on the design canvas. Once the action has been copied, find the desired location on the
design canvas, right-click on a drop zone and select Paste.
Note: The configuration of the pasted action can then be modified independently of the original.
Delete: Select to remove the action and any modifications made to it from the workflow.
Disable: Select to disable the action from the workflow. Once the action is disabled it will be
omitted when the workflow is run and hidden from status views. The action will appear dimmed
when it is disabled.

Note: When an action is disabled, its child actions are also disabled.

The workflow action can also be disabled from the Actions dialog box. To do this, click
Common in the Ribbon and check the Disable box.

5.2 About connections

Connections are sets of connection parameters to external providers. When a connection to an
external provider is defined, you can use that connection in workflows anywhere on the
SharePoint site.

You can limit connections to your user account if desired. Permissions checks for user-specific
connections are performed during selection of connections in action configuration and during
publishing of workflows.

External providers that use connections include DocuSign, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and
Salesforce. This list is not exhaustive; connection-specific providers are subject to change
between releases of this product.

If a connection is deleted, then any currently running workflows that reference the connection
are stopped and the workflows cannot be republished until a valid connection is selected for the
affected actions.

5.3 Association columns

The Association Columns feature is used to associate site columns with the workflow definition.
Association columns are useful where you may need to reference columns for the ‘current item!

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
from within a reusable workflow. Association columns are automatically added to a list or
library when a reusable workflow is associated to that list or library.

The Association Columns dialog allows associations to site columns to be created, added,
deleted or modified.

Each Association Column is defined within the workflow definition. If these columns exist in the
target library or list, they will be used. If they do not exist, they will be added to the target library
or modified and deleted. Whilst Association Columns are predominantly used in reusable
workflows associated with content types, they do not associate with the content type itself,
instead any defined columns are added to the relevant list or library where the content type is
deployed.

Please note: Association columns do not work on site workflows.
To access the Association Column dialog box:
1. Navigate to the List Workflow you want to create Association Columns on.

2. Click on Workflow Settings in the Ribbon.
3. Select Association Columns.

Store error occurrence in Please select SA
Store error text in Please select —m

Error handling options

Capture Errors

This option specifies whether or not to turn on the capturing of errors. If this option is set to
'Yes', an error in the action will no longer cause the workflow to fail. Instead, the values
described in the next two sections will be populated. Apart from using the values provided in the
drop-down, a Yes/No workflow variable can be used.

Store error occurrence in

Specify a Yes/No workflow variable that will store whether or not an error has occurred. The
variable will be set to Yes if an error occurred and No if the action execution completed.

Store error text in

Specify a text workflow variable that will store the details of an error if one occurs. This value
will be set to empty if no error occurs.

Note: The Store error occurrence in and Store error text in workflow variables will not be
modified if Capture Errors is set to No.

5.7 Importing and exporting workflows

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Nintex workflows can be imported and exported to the local file system as 'nwf' files. This can
be used to copy workflows from one server to another, or other file transfer scenarios.

For Reusable Workflow Templates, the workflow designer ribbon button Export to VS is
enabled, allowing users to export the workflow as a '.wsp' file which can be imported into

Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
Exporting a workflow
To export a workflow:

e Click the Export button.

e The export file will be created and will trigger the file download process in the web
browser. For example, in Internet Explorer 8 the following dialog will appear:

-
File Download =)

Do you want to save this file. or find a program online to open
it?

Name: Set_a_condition.nwf
Type: Unknown File Type, 17.7KB
From: w2010-1

=a Gee)

. ] While files from the Intemet can be useful, some files can potentially
harm your computer. if you do not trust the source, do not find a
program to open this file or save this file. What's the risk?

L 4

e Click the Save button and follow the standard procedure for downloading and saving
files from the web browser. Consult the web browser documentation for more
information on downloading and saving files.

The Export button also contains a drop down menu option Export to Visual Studio. Click this
option to export the workflow as a Visual Studio 2012 solution file.

Note: Not all workflow types such as list workflows or site workflows can be exported to Visual
Studio. Only Reusable Workflows created in Nintex Workflow 2013 can be exported to Visual

Studio 2012.

Importing a workflow
To import a workflow:

e Click the Import button.
e The Import Workflow dialog will appear:

Note: Importing a workflow will cause unsaved changes to be lost.

e Click the Browse button and locate the 'nwf' file to import.

The previously exported workflow, with all its settings should now be displayed on the design
canvas.

Note: Only workflows created by Nintex Workflow 2010 & Nintex Workflow 2013 can be
imported.

5.8 Inline functions

In any text input that supports Inserting reference fields, an inline function can be entered that
will be resolved at workflow run-time.

A number of functions are provided out of the box, and additional functions can be added with
the NWAdmin.exe tool.

Functions can also be used as arguments for other functions.
Example:

Insert Reference *

You have fn-DateDiffDays({Workflow variable:Start} Workflow variable:End}) days to complete
this task.

The product ID is fn-Substring({T extStart}{ItemProperty: Title} TextEnd},2,5)

Function behavior

The parsing engine first replaces any inserted reference tokens, and then the resulting text is
evaluated for functions.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
If a function contains another function as an argument, the inner most function will be evaluated
first.

As reference tokens are replaced first, the reference token can also contain function syntax that
will be evaluated.

If text used for a function argument contains function syntax (i.e. a brace or comma character)
wrap the argument with {TextStart} and {TextEnd} to indicate a block of text that should not be
parsed further.

For example, if a number variable that contains a decimal value is passed to the function, and the
decimal separator for your region is a comma, the {TextStart} and {TextEnd} tokens will need
to be used.

In the example shown above, when the ""Title"" of the item is returned, if it were to contain a
comma, and the {TextStart} {TextEnd} blocks were not used, then the Substring function would

treat the text after the first comma as the second argument, instead of the number ""2"" provided,
and the function would error.

5.16 Publishing a workflow

Before a workflow becomes available to users within SharePoint lists and libraries it must be
published.”

To publish a workflow:
e Click the Publish button on the main Ribbon toolbar.
e The application will then validate the workflow and publish it.”“‘Note: the workflow is
automatically saved before it is published, so it is not necessary to Save and then Publish

a workflow.

Note: Not all users have permission to publish workflows. For information about which users
can publish workflows, please refer to the Security Settings.

The process of validation and publishing may take a few seconds before the published message
is shown:

The workflow has been published.

OK

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
If there are errors in the workflow, including actions that are not configured, the workflow will
not publish, and the following message is displayed:

Message from webpage ==

The workflow is not valid and cannot be published. The following
A actions need to be configured:
Send notification

Once the workflow is published it can be managed from the Managing Workflows page.

5.17 Run Now

Use the Run Now button to test an action without republishing the whole workflow design.
Click on the Run Now button in the action Ribbon to open the Run Now dialog.

Run Now dialog

Note: Run Now is not a simulation, any executions such as create, query, update and delete that are made will be
committed when executing the Run Now. Use this page to temporarily change parameter values and test the
configuration settings of the action.

The Run Now dialog shows the current configurations for the action and allows reference tokens
to be replaced before the Run Now dialog is executed.

By default, the Run Now dialog will:

e Automatically replace any tokens with a value if possible
e Evaluate any inline functions in the action when the run now is executed

Note: The replacements and changes made to parameter values used in the Run Now is only
temporary; these parameter values are not saved to the action once the Run Now dialog is closed.

Parameters

The parameters will reflect the available configuration settings of the action the Run Now dialog
is launched from.

Test connection

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
This will verify that the connection details to an external system are correct. This option appears
on selected Run Now dialogs depending on the action it is launched from.

Result
Displays the output of the action once the Run Now has been executed.

Some actions with Run Now, interact with data or systems outside of the workflow. By default,
the Run Now feature is allowed on all sites that do not have workflow change approval enabled.

To change the Run Now preferences:
1. Navigate to Central Administration, click on Nintex Workflow Management.
2. Click on Global settings.
3. Locate Allow ‘Run now’ on actions that interact with external data and make the
desired change.

4. Click OK.

Actions that support Run Now and only operate on workflow context data will always have the
Run Now feature available.

5.18 Set action labels

The text displayed around an activity can be configured. Adding labels to a workflow action
provides a user with more context around what the action is doing without the need to see
the workflow action configuration.
Editing the Labels
There are two ways to edit the labels for a workflow action.
1. To edit the label in-line on the workflow action itself:

e Inthe design canvas where the workflow action is located, click on the title bar.

e Enter the text desired in the different label areas on the workflow action.
e Click away from the workflow action to commit changes to the label.

2. To edit the label within the 'Configure action’ dialog:

e In the workflow action, click the title bar and select Configure from the drop down menu
options.

e Inthe Configure action dialog, within the Ribbon, click on Labels.

e Configure the action title and text to display to the left, right and bottom of the action.

Note: The action title is used in workflow reports to indicate the current status of a running
workflow.

Action Notes
The action notes are displayed in the print with notes view.
Notes to display:
e System generated: The default workflow action notes are used.
e User defined: Custom notes that can be defined by the user in the User defined notes
for the workflow action .

e System generated and user defined: The default workflow action notes and custom
notes can be defined and used for the workflow action.

User defined notes
The textbox is only enabled when the Notes to display selected is User defined or System

generated and user defined. Entering a value will display the custom notes in the print with

item within a list or library in the current site. When List Lookup is selected, additional options
are provided where the Source and Field of the List Lookup will need to be set.

EB

The default source is set to use the current item. All available properties that are defined for the
Source will be listed in the Field list.

Alternatively, a property on another item in any list within the site can be set. After selecting a

Source, select a Field containing the value to be used. Using the When and Equals options, an
item in the source list can be located.

Equals Value | Finance Jan 2012 B

Note: Using a List Lookup is a useful solution for solving the problem of environment-specific
configuration values. By creating a list to hold the configuration variables, lookups can

be used to retrieve the settings at runtime that may differ between the different environments
such as 'Development' and 'Production'. This helps to avoid hard-coding these settings into the
workflow templates and having to change them as they are deployed between the environments.

For information about lookups used in the Nintex Workflow Message Templates, please refer
to Defining message templates.

Workflow Context

The Workflow Context option allows a value associated with the current workflow to be set and
used within the workflow action.

Workflow Context | ¥]/|All Approver Comments im

The available values selectable within the Workflow Context is the same as the values provided
in the 'Common' tab when Insert Reference is used within the Walue source.

The main difference in using the Workflow Context vs Value is that the Workflow Context
method allows the returned value to be set as a different data type (string, number, etc.); whereas
selecting a value through the Insert Reference function within the Value source sets the value
returned with its default type with no ability to change the data type.

User Profiles
The User Profiles source allows a reference to be made to a user profile property of the specified
Account Name. When User Profiles is selected, additional options are provided where the

Source and Account Name value will need to be set.

The Source is the value that will be retrieved based on the value of the Account Name. All
available user profile properties will be listed in the Source field.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
E.g. John Smith has the Account Name of ‘jsmith'. The following example will return John
Smith's department value specified in his SharePoint user profile property.

User Profile lookups are only available in environments that have Microsoft SharePoint Server
2013, and not available in Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013.

Workflow Constant

The Workflow Constant option allows a value that has been set globally either at the Farm, Site
Collection or Site level to be used within the workflow action.

Workflow Constants |¥]| SAP web service URL|*

The values contained within the workflow constant are not made visible to a user when
designing the workflow. Users are only shown the name of the workflow constant.

5.20 Verbose logging

Verbose logging adds increased context data when viewing the history of a workflow instance.
The value of all workflow variables and item properties are stored before and after each
workflow action, along with additional diagnostics information such as the process the workflow
was running in and the server which was executing the workflow.

Enabling verbose logging
Verbose logging must first be enabled in the farm before it can be enabled in a workflow.
To enable verbose logging:
e Navigate to Global Settings page.
e Inthe Allow verbose workflow logging section, set to Yes.
e Inthe Number of days to keep verbose logs, set the number of days to keep verbose

workflow logs. Logs will be deleted when the workflow completes after the specified
number of days.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: A workflow with verbose logging enabled will add more data to the workflow database
than one without, therefore there is an automatic purge process to remove verbose information
after a number of days.

Allow vetbose workflow logging

verbose workflow logging:
No

jays to keep verbose logs

Global settings are cached and refreshed automatically every 15 minutes. For changes to take
affect immediately, perform an IISRESET and restart the Windows SharePoint Services timer
service.

Once verbose logging is enabled on the web farm, it can be enabled on a workflow.
To enable verbose logging for a workflow:

e Click on Workflow Settings button in the main Ribbon toolbar.
e Inthe Workflow Settings dialog, check the Enable verbose logging option.
e Click on the Save button.

Viewing verbose logs

Verbose information is available from the Viewing workflow status of a workflow. If the
instance is run with verbose logging enabled, and the verbose data has not yet been cleared, a
message in the workflow information panel will state that verbose logging information is
available. If verbose data is available, each workflow action can be clicked on to bring up the
verbose information panel. The panel shows each data item available to the workflow, with the
values before and after the action executed. If any value changed, it will be highlighted.

There are options to export the verbose information for a particular action or the entire verbose
log to an xml file.

Considerations when using verbose logging

Verbose logging adds a significant amount of data to the Nintex Workflow database. The data is
not intended to be kept for a long time. The verbose logging feature is intended as an assistant
for workflow development and testing, and is not intended to be left on in production.

child actions, to be hidden from the workflow history or graphical progress view.
This will also cause the action to not be tracked in the workflow database.

Note: The 'Request Approval’, 'Request Review' and 'Request Data' actions can be
hidden from the graphical status view, but will still be displayed in the workflow
history and logged in the database.

Run as workflow owner: Checking this option will cause this action, and any

child actions, to run using the credentials of the user who published the workflow
instead of the user who started the workflow.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: The Run as workflow owner option will only appear when the action is in the root level
of the workflow. If it is embedded in a ""Run If"" action, a branch of a ""State Machine"", a
""Parallel"" action, ""Flexi Task"" action or ""Loop"" action, this option is not available. This is due to
a limitation in SharePoint, all actions inside a parent action must run using the same user.

5.22 Workflow Constants

Workflow Constants are globally set values available to all workflows at the specified

level (web farm, site collection, or site). Use workflow constants to store credentials, URLs,
LDAP paths, SQL connection strings, and any other values that need to be used in multiple
workflows.

Inserting workflow constants into workflow actions

You can insert credentials and other defined workflow constants into workflow actions. During
workflow design, the values contained within a workflow constant are not visible; only the name
of the workflow constant is shown.

Editing permissions for workflow constants

You can edit permissions for workflow constants to allow only specified users and groups to see
and use the workflow constant when designing a workflow. Permissions are checked when the
workflow is published.

Note: If an existing workflow is modified by another workflow designer who does not have
permissions to see and use a workflow constant being used in that workflow, then the workflow
will save; however, republishing of the workflow will not be allowed. Only workflow designers
who have been granted permission to see and use the workflow constant will be able to publish
the workflow. Because this security check is performed when the workflow is published, no
currently published workflow using workflow constants can be re-published by someone without
permissions to the referenced workflow constants. Therefore, if the permissions for a workflow
constant are changed, a workflow that is already using the constant will continue to use the value
successfully.

To edit permissions for a workflow constant:

1. Access the Manage workflow constants page for the desired level (web farm, site
collection, or site).
o Web farm level: On the Central Administration Home page, click Nintex
Workflow Management and then click Manage workflow constants.
o Site collection level: Do the following.

e Start when items are modified (available for list and library workflows only): When a
library or list item is modified, all workflows in the library or list with this option enabled
will start. Checking-in a document will not trigger a workflow to start.

o Conditional: Displays the Conditions button to define conditions for starting the
workflow (conditional start configuration). This button displays the Conditional
Startup Options dialog box, which contains settings for defining one or more
conditions based on field, operator, and value or field.

e Enable verbose logging: When this setting is checked, verbose information is available
for the workflow. Please refer to Verbose logging.

e Publish without validation: Advanced option. Specifies that a validation step is skipped
when the workflow is published. Not validating the workflow is not recommended. If the
workflow is large and takes a significant length of time to publish, choosing to skip
validation will help decrease how long the publish operation takes. However, if a
validation issue is missed, the workflow may show unexpected errors.

e Enable workflow to start from the item menu: When this setting is checked, the
workflow is displayed and can be started from the item's context menu. All other menu
item related options are dependent on this setting being checked.

e Menu item label: The label for the workflow when displayed in the item's context menu.

e Menu item image URL: The URL of the icon for the workflow when displayed in the
item's context menu. The URL can be absolute or site relative.

e Menu item position: The order priority of the workflow within the item's context menu
relative to the other menu items.

e Enable custom history messages: When this setting is checked, actions which have
""Message to log on completion set' will be included in the Workflow History. Please refer
to Workflow Action Common Settings.

e Create workflow status column: When this setting is checked, a column with the
workflow's name will be added to the list or library when this workflow runs.

e Expected workflow duration: The workflow will record this duration in the database for
reporting purposes.

e Task list: All tasks created by a workflow are stored in a SharePoint task list on the team
site. This option allows the task list that the workflow uses to be changed from the
default.

e History list: As the workflow progresses, each step within the workflow is recorded in
the SharePoint workflow history list. This option allows a history list that has been
enabled for Nintex Workflow to be selected. Please refer to Managing workflow history
lists.

e Form type: Specify if the start form to be used is the default, custom, or InfoPath form.

Ribbon menu buttons

e Wariables: Create workflow variables and start data. Please refer to Workflow variables.

e Association Columns: Specify site columns that will be associated with this workflow.
Please refer to Association columns.

e Edit Start Form: Edit the start form with Microsoft InfoPath 2013. If InfoPath 2013 is
not installed on the user's PC, an alert will be shown and no form editing will occur.

Note: Workflows are associated with a library or a list. Folders and sub-folders within libraries
are subject to the same workflows as the parent library. Therefore, if a workflow is set to start
when items are created or modified, any item, regardless of how many folders or sub-folders
down it is stored, will trigger all the workflows that are set to start automatically.

5.25 Workflow Snippets

The Snippets feature provides the ability to reuse a predefined set of actions in the same
sequence easily. For a set of actions which may be reused frequently, the user can choose to save
the set of actions as a snippet. The saved snippet can then be used within the current workflow or
in other workflows within the same site collection.

Creating a snippet
There are two ways to create a snippet.
1. To save an entire workflow as a snippet:

e Inthe Nintex Workflow Designer Ribbon, below the Save, expand the available options
by clicking ~ .
e Click on Save as Snippet.

Note: This will save the entire workflow as a snippet.

workflow actions - the snippet icon will not appear on the workflow canvas.

To delete a snippet:
e Locate the snippet in the Workflow Actions Toolbox and right-click on the snippet

itself.
e Inthe Context menu, select the Delete option.

5.26 Workflow start data

Start data is data that must be collected when the workflow is started. When a user starts the
workflow, they will be presented with a form requesting this information.

Note: Start Data will only appear if the workflow is set to start manually, if the workflow starts
automatically, the start data fields will not appear and if default values are set, they will be used

for the variables.

Start data is configured by creating workflow variables and setting the Show on start form
option to 'True' for the variable to be shown.

For more information please refer to the Workflow variables.

5.27 Workflow templates

Workflow templates provides the ability to create a new workflow using the basis of a
saved workflow template. By using workflow templates, workflow designers are able to
save a considerable amount of time without the need to build a similar workflow already in
existence from scratch.

Workflow templates are associated at a Site Collection level. Saved workflow templates will
only be available for reuse within the site collection the workflow was saved from. In order to
use a workflow template from a different site collection, use the export workflow and import
workflow features. Refer to Importing and exporting workflows.

Selecting a workflow template
To create a new workflow based on a workflow template:
e Navigate to the site, list or library (depending on the type of workflow to be created).

e Click on Create a Workflow.

5.28 Workflow variables

Workflows retrieve data from a data source at run time, workflow variables provides the ability
to store data somewhere in order to use it in the conditions and actions within the

workflow. Different types of data can be stored in a workflow variable. A workflow variable can
also be used to get data from users on workflow start.

Some examples of when workflow variables are useful:

e The workflow requires a value for conditional actions which is a combination of values
that exist already in the system. For example, these values can be set using the Math
operation or Build Dynamic String actions.

e¢ Workflows developed in a development environment for deployment to testing and then
subsequently deployed to production environments. To avoid using hard coded values in
the workflow that must be manually updated during deployment, workflow variables can

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
be used to load values from other lists via Using lookups. e.g. a URL to be used in an
email may be different for each environment, this can be sourced at runtime from a
configuration list within each environment using the Set a variable action.

e A workflow may require the creation of another list item that will need to be queried later
using a lookup or deleted automatically depending on further logic in a workflow. E.g. a
new report requires that a meeting is organised, but during the workflow an administrator
has rejected the report. Therefore the calendar event needs to be deleted.

It is not always appropriate or possible to store some of these values as meta data of the item
attached to the workflow. To provide the means and flexibility to handle these kinds of scenarios

Nintex Workflow provides workflow variables.

5.29 XPath Query Builder
The XML Browser is found within the XPath Query Builder.

The XML Browser is used to select an element in the XML structure. If the XML source
specified for the action is available and all tokens and references are replaced with actual run
time values, then the XPath Builder will use the XML source to display the XML structure
within the XML Browser.

If the XML source specified for the action is not available, the XML data that is required to
generate the Tree View in the XML Browser must be provided manually. Use the XML Source
button in the Ribbon to provide sample XML data. This will provide the XML data required to
populate the Tree View.

Sample XML data can be entered by:
e Typing the XML data into the text box.
Or

e Select Import XML and upload a file or URL to populate the text box.

© 2015 Nintex Global Ltd. All rights reserved. Nintex Confidential
Note: If the workflow is being designed on an InfoPath form library, the XML Browser will load
the InfoPath form template that has been uploaded to the form library in the Tree View if the
action’s XML source selected is Current item.

To select the node to be used within the action:
1. Once the sample XML is available, select Tree View in the Ribbon.

2. Expand the nodes to select the element or attribute.
3. Click Apply in the Ribbon.

Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and

the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first

chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College
primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were
gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the
central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President
Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869-1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional
schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of
American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great
Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the

war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.

re DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
Before You Begin

Refer to the sections for system and farm requirements that must be in place prior to installing and
using Granular Backup and Restore.

Configuration

In order to use Granular Backup and Restore, the DocAve 6 platform must be installed and configured
properly on your farm. Granular Backup and Restore will not function without DocAve 6 present on the
farm.

Agents

DocAve Agents are responsible for running DocAve jobs and interacting with the SharePoint object
model. DocAve Agents enable DocAve Manager to communicate with the respective servers, allowing
for Granular Backup and Restore commands to function properly.

*Note: The use of system resources on a server increases when the installed agent is performing
actions. This may affect server performance. However, if the agent installed on a server is not being
used, the use of system resources is very low; therefore, the effect on server performance is negligible.

For instructions on installing the DocAve Platform, DocAve Manager, and DocAve Agents, see the
DocAve 6 Installation Guide.

Configuring Devices and Setting Up Storage Policies

In order to perform a backup job using Granular Backup and Restore, it is necessary to first configure
one or more physical devices and then set up a storage policy.

When performing a backup job, Granular Backup and Restore can write to Net Share, FTP, Amazon S3,
AT&T Synaptic, Caringo Storage, Dell DX Storage, Dropbox, EMC Centera, HDS Hitachi Content Platform,
IBM Storwize Family, Rackspace Cloud File, OneDrive, TSM, or Windows Azure Storage.

In addition, DocAve has the ability to treat multiple storage devices as a single logical unit when saving
backup data. This feature is especially useful for very large backup plans, as many small drives can be
combined. A logical drive must be defined before creating a backup plan.

For instructions on defining devices and setting up storage policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel
Reference Guide.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
Performing a Backup

There are several ways to configure and perform a granular backup. Once you select the content you
want, you can run backups using the following methods:

e Using Ad Hoc Backup
e Using the Plan Builder (Using Wizard Mode or Using Form Mode)

For more information regarding backup and recovery, refer to the Microsoft TechNet article Backup and
recovery best practices (SharePoint Server 2010) and Backup and Restore (SharePoint 2013). For the
elements in SharePoint 2013 that are supported to be backed up, refer to Elements Unsupported to Be
Backed Up in SharePoint 2013.

Overview of Backup Types

When configuring a backup plan using the Using the Plan Builder or Predefined Schemes, there are three
backup types you can select from to perform a backup job: Full, Incremental, or Differential.

The Full option backs up all of the selected data each time a backup is performed. This option requires
the most storage space because, depending upon the size of your SharePoint environment, each backup
file can be substantial in size. Unlike incremental and differential backups, all full backup files are
independent of one another and do not have any dependencies on other back up data files. However,
because each of the backups is comprehensive, full backup jobs take the longest to complete of the
three available options.

The Incremental option backs up only the content that has been updated since the last backup,
drastically reducing the size of the backup file created. The most common option, this backup requires
less storage than a full or differential backup. Incremental backups reduce execution time, thereby
allowing for shorter backup windows. It is important to note, however, that in order to recover all of the
most recent SharePoint data from an incremental backup, all of the backup files must be available.
Consider each incremental backup file as a piece of the whole SharePoint environment. If one of these
files is not available, the full SharePoint environment cannot be restored.

For example, the following four cylinders represent four backups and they are performed in this order—
Full Backup, Incremental Backup, Incremental Backup, Incremental Backup:

Figure 3: One Full backup followed by three Incremental backups.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
1. The first Incremental Backup backs up the newly-added data in the blue period.
2. The second Incremental Backup backs up the newly-added data in the green period.
3. The third Incremental Backup backs up the newly-added data in the orange period.

Each time it runs, the Differential option backs up all content that has been updated since the last full
backup. These backup files are larger in size than incremental files, but smaller than full backup files. In
order to recover all of the most recent SharePoint content, the first full backup file and latest differential
backup file are required.

For example, the following four cylinders represent four backups and they are performed in this order —
Full Backup, Differential Backup, Differential Backup, Differential Backup:

Figure 4: One Full backup followed by three Differential backups.
1. The first Differential Backup backs up the newly-added data in the blue period.
2. The second Differential Backup backs up the newly-added data in the green period.
3. The third Differential Backup backs up the newly-added data in the orange period.

*Note: Due to SharePoint API limitations, when you run an incremental or a differential backup at the
site collection level using the same plan, the Apps and AppData in the site collection that was backed up
in the previous full backup job will also be fully backed up.

Selecting Content to Back Up

There are two options to select the content to back up: Browse and Search. To select the content to
back up, refer to the sections below.

*Note: If the content is stub content, DocAve only backs up real files of those stubs generated by EBS
and RBS. In addition, Granular Backup jobs will not capture linked content.
Selecting Content by Search

For a large environment, use the search function to quickly locate the target content. To use the search
function, complete the following steps:

1. Locate the Source panel on the left-hand side of the screen.

2. Inthe search field at the top of the Source tab, enter the characters from the SharePoint object
URL or name you want to search for.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

5.

Click the magnifying glass (2!) to start the search or wait a moment for it to start automatically.
When the search is running, you can click the stop button |“! to stop the search, if needed.

Select the relevant objects that you want to back up by clicking the checkboxes to the left of the
objects. You can select objects in one farm.

*Note: When you use the Select All node to select all of the child nodes under your selected
node, the Include New function takes effect automatically for this plan/job. Even a SharePoint
object is created in the selected scope after the plan is saved, the content under the node can
be backed up automatically by the backup job.

e If you directly select the Select All option, the current nodes and the new nodes created
after the backup plan is saved will be backed up in the backup job.

e If you manually selected all of the nodes one by one, the Select All option will be
automatically selected, but the new nodes created after the backup plan is saved will
not be backed up in the backup job.

After selecting content, choose to perform either a backup using the Using Ad Hoc Backup or a
backup using the Using the Plan Builder.

Selecting Content by Browse

To browse through the SharePoint farm objects, complete the following steps:

1.

3.

From the Source panel on the left, double-click the farm that contains the relevant SharePoint
content. A list of objects appears beneath the farm entry.

Select the relevant objects that you want to back up by clicking the checkboxes to the left of the
object. You can select objects in one farm.

*Note: When you use the Select All node to select all of the child nodes under your selected
node, the Include New function takes effect automatically for this plan/job. Even a SharePoint
object is created in the selected scope after the plan is saved, the content under the node can
be backed up automatically by the backup job.

e If you directly select the Select All option, the current nodes and the new nodes created
after the backup plan is saved will be backed up in the backup job.

e If you manually selected all of the nodes one by one, the Select All option will be
automatically selected, but the new nodes created after the backup plan is saved will
not be backed up in the backup job.

After selecting content, choose to perform either a backup using the Using Ad Hoc Backup or a
backup using the Using the Plan Builder. See the appropriate section below.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
About Ad Hoc Backup

An Ad Hoc Backup backs up the selected content immediately (without setting up a schedule) using the

default settings, which need to be configured prior to running the backup.

*Note: An Ad Hoc backup is a back-end process, meaning that the job runs in the background. The user
can continue to navigate through the user interface without having to first terminate the running job.

To use Ad Hoc Backup, you must first define the default settings, as described below.

Configuring Default Settings

To use Ad Hoc Backup, it is necessary to first configure the default settings. To configure default backup

settings, complete the following steps:

1.
2.

After Selecting Content to Back Up, click Ad Hoc Backup on the ribbon of the Backup tab.
Select Default Settings from the drop-down list. The Default Settings page appears.

Storage Policy — Select the storage policy for the backup data, or create a new storage policy in
the Specify a storage policy drop-down list. A storage policy is used to configure a set of rules
for storing backed up data. It also supports the following functions:

e Pruning the data backed up by Granular Backup and Restore and delete or move the
pruned backup data.

e When you add more than one Media services in a storage policy, it supports the
automatic failover that causes another Media service in the storage policy to take over
the role of the Media service that is down during the backup job.

For more information on working with storage policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel
Reference Guide.

Filter Policy — Select a filter policy or create a new one to limit the scope of the backup job by
making a selection from the drop-down list in the Filter Policy field. A filter policy sets up filter
rules to control what objects will be backed up. For more information on working with filter
policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel Reference Guide.

*Note: When using the filter policy for backing up data stored in SharePoint Online, the Created
By criterion is not supported. The job using the Created By criterion will have a Failed status.
The information will be recorded in the job report.

User Profile — Select whether or not to Include user profile. This option decides if user profiles
are going to be backed up with the security.

Workflow — Select how you want to manage the workflow in the source.
e Include workflow definition — Backs up only the definition of existing source workflows.

e Include workflow instance — Backs up the state, history, and tasks of each item. This
option is available after selecting Include workflow definition.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
7. Data Compression — Select an optional data compression setting. Select the Compression
checkbox to enable data compression, and then choose a compression level using the slider. A
low compression level results in a faster compression rate but a larger data block, while a high
compression level results in a slower compression rate but a smaller, better quality data block.

*Note: Small data blocks cause slower backup and additional recovery time. Select whether to
leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service) resources or SharePoint Server (SharePoint
Agent) resources for compression.

8. Data Encryption — Select the Encryption checkbox (optional) to enable data encryption. Select
whether to leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service) resources or SharePoint Server
(SharePoint Agent) resources for encryption. Then, select a security profile or create a new one

In order to perform an Ad Hoc Backup, you must first configure the Configuring Default Settings.
To initiate an ad hoc backup, complete the following steps:

1. After Selecting Content to Back Up, click Ad Hoc Backup on the ribbon of the Backup tab.
2. Select Ad Hoc Backup from the drop-down list. The Ad Hoc Backup page appears.

3. DocAve automatically loads your Configuring Default Settings into the Ad Hoc Backup page. Edit
these settings as needed.

4. Click Run Now at the bottom of the window to start the backup job. View the job details in Job
Monitor.

Using the Plan Builder

Configuring Plan Builder is very similar to configuring the default settings for an Ad Hoc Backup. Use the
Plan Builder when you want to schedule a backup and define the type of backup (Full, Incremental, or
Differential) or when you want to use the Predefined Schemes feature.

*Note: A backup run with Plan Builder is a back-end process, meaning that the job runs in the
background. The user can continue to navigate through the user interface without having to first cancel
the running job.

To use the Plan Builder, complete the following steps:

1. After Selecting Content to Back Up, click Plan Builder from the Backup tab.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

2. From the drop-down menu, select Using Wizard Mode for step-by-step guidance during
configuration, or select Using Form Mode (recommended for advanced users only).

See the section below applicable to your choice.

Using Wizard Mode

To configure a plan using Wizard Mode, complete the following steps:

*Note: A red asterisk (*) marked next to a field in the DocAve GUI indicates a mandatory field.

1. Plan Name — Enter a Plan Name and an optional Description, if desired. Click Next. The Storage
Policy page appears.

2. Storage Policy — Configure the following settings:

Storage Policy — Select the storage policy for the backup data, or create a new storage
policy in the Specify a storage policy drop-down list. A storage policy is used to
configure a set of rules for storing backed up data. And it also supports the following
functions:

o Pruning the data backed up by Granular Backup and Restore and delete or move
the pruned backup data.

o When you add more than one Media services in a storage policy, it supports the
automatic failover that causes another Media service in the storage policy to
take over the role of the Media service that is down during the backup job.

For more information on working with storage policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control
Panel Reference Guide.

Data Compression — If you want to enable data compression, you can optionally select
the Compression checkbox, and then choose a compression level using the slider. A low
compression level results in a faster compression rate but a larger data block, while a
high compression level results in a slower compression rate but a smaller, better quality
data block.

*Note: Small data blocks cause slower backup and additional recovery time. Select
whether to leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service) resources or SharePoint
Server (SharePoint Agent) resources for compression.

Data Encryption — If you want to enable data encryption, you can optionally select the
Encryption checkbox. Select whether to leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service)
resources or SharePoint Server (SharePoint Agent) resources for encryption. Then,
select a security profile or create a new one in the Security profile drop-down list. For
more information on working with security profiles, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel
Reference Guide.

*Note: Encrypting data causes slower backup and additional recovery time.

Click Next when you are finished configuring the storage policy. The Schedule page appears.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
3. Schedule — Select a scheduling option. Note that this field determines the type of backup (Full,
Incremental, or Differential) that will be run.

and run the backup job by schedule. Click Add Schedule to set up a schedule. The Add
Schedule window appears. In the Options section, select a backup type from the drop-
down list. For more information, see Overview of Backup Types.

o Full Backup — A full backup of the selected source.

o Incremental Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the content that has been
updated since the last backup, whether it’s Full, Incremental, or Differential.

o Differential Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the data that has been
updated since the last full backup.

*Note: For SharePoint apps, no matter which backup type you choose, Granular Backup
job will perform a full backup for the apps in the selected scope.

After configuring the schedule, click Calendar View to view the scheduled plans by day,
week, or month.

*Note: Frequent consecutive differential backups have a tendency to repeatedly back
up the same data, which fills disk space quickly. For best results when conducting high
frequency backups, it is recommended to use incremental backups. Incremental
backups save time and storage space by backing up only the differences between
incremental backups or an incremental backup and a full backup, instead of backing up
the entire source location.

Click Next when you are finished. The Restore Granularity Level appears.

4. Restore Granularity Level — Select a granularity level to restore: Item, Site, or Site Collection.
Review the table to learn the pros, cons, and recommendations for each selection. Click Next

following steps:

*Note: A red asterisk (*) marked next to a field in the DocAve GUI indicates a mandatory field.

1. Plan Name - Enter a Plan Name and optional Description, if desired.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

2. Storage Policy — Select a storage policy for the backup data or create a new one in the Specify a
storage policy drop-down list. A storage policy is used to configure a set of rules for storing
backed up data. It also supports the following functions:

e Pruning the data backed up by Granular Backup and Restore and delete or move the
pruned backup data.

e When you add more than one Media services in a storage policy, it supports the
automatic failover that causes another Media service in the storage policy to take over
the role of the Media service that is down during the backup job.

For more information on working with storage policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel
Reference Guide.

3. Schedule Selection — Select a scheduling option.

*Note: This field determines the type of backup (Full, Incremental, or Differential) that will be
run.

e No Schedule — Select this option to configure the job to not run on a schedule (the job
must be manually initiated).

e Select a Predefined Scheme - Select this option to run the backup on a Predefined
Schemes.

e Configure the schedule myself — Select this option to configure a customized schedule,
and run the backup job by schedule. Click Add Schedule to set up a schedule. The Add
Schedule window appears. In the Options section, select a backup type from the drop-
down list. For more information, see Overview of Backup Types.

o Full Backup — A full backup of the selected source.

o Incremental Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the data that has been
added since the last incremental or full backup.

o Differential Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the data that has been
updated since the last full backup.

After configuring the schedule, click Calendar View to view the scheduled plans by day,
week, or month.

*Note: Frequent consecutive differential backups have a tendency to repeatedly back
up the same data, which fills disk space quickly. For best results when conducting high
frequency backups, it is recommended to use incremental backups. Incremental
backups save time and storage space by backing up only the differences between
incremental backups or an incremental backup and a full backup, instead of backing up
the entire source location.

4. Restore Granularity Level — Select a granularity level to restore: Item, Site, or Site Collection.

5. Filter Policy — Select a Filter Policy to limit the scope of the backup job. For more information on
working with filter policies, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel Reference Guide.

Data Compression — If you want to enable data compression, you can optionally select
the Compression checkbox, and then choose a compression level using the slider. A low
compression level results in a faster compression rate but a larger data block, while a
high compression level results in a slower compression rate but a smaller, better quality
data block. Note that small data blocks cause slower backup and additional recovery
time. Select whether to leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service) resources or
SharePoint Server (SharePoint Agent) resources for compression.

Data Encryption — If you want to enable data encryption, you can optionally select the
Encryption checkbox. Note that encrypting data causes slower backup and additional
recovery time. Select whether to leverage DocAve Media Server (Media Service)
resources or SharePoint Server (SharePoint Agent) resources for encryption. Then,
select a security profile or create a new one in the Security profile drop-down list. For
more information on working with security profiles, refer to the DocAve 6 Control Panel
Reference Guide.

Agent Group — Select the agent group for the backup data or create a new agent group
from the drop-down list. For more information on working with agent groups, refer to
the DocAve 6 Control Panel Reference Guide.

Elements Unsupported to Be Backed Up in SharePoint 2013

The following elements in SharePoint 2013, including SharePoint objects, settings, data, etc. are not
supported to be backed up by Granular Backup and Restore:

Element Description

Access AppData Granular Backup and Restore does not support backing up and restoring the
Access AppData with the Access App in SharePoint 2013 on-premises
environment. Access App has an Access Service database to store its own
data. However, DocAve cannot access the database to obtain the app data.
Only the Access App can be backed up and restored to the destination.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
Performing a Restore

A granular restore can be performed only on data backed up using DocAve’s Granular Backup and
Restore. The three restore types are:

e In place restore — Restores the selected backed-up data to its original location in
SharePoint.

e Out of place restore — Restores the data to a location in SharePoint other than the
original location.

e Restore to file system — Restores the selected backed-up content directly to a file
system.

For more information regarding backup and recovery, refer to the Microsoft TechNet article Backup and
recovery best practices (SharePoint Server 2010) and Backup and Restore (SharePoint 2013).

Defining General Settings
Before performing a restore, you may want to define the following general settings: User Mapping,

Domain Mapping, and Language Mapping.

When finished, click Next. The Restore Type page appears. Refer to Restore Type for
proceeding.

Restore Type

In Place Restore is designed to restore the selected backed-up data to its original location in SharePoint.
Out of Place Restore is used to restore the data to a location in SharePoint other than the original
location. Restore to File System is aimed to restore the selected backed-up content directly to a file
system.

In Place Restore
To use an in place restore to restore granularly back-up data to its original location in SharePoint,
complete the following steps:

1. Restore Type — After configuring the restore as described in the previous Time-Based Restore or
Object-Based Restore sections, configure the following settings:

e Restore Type — Select the In place restore radio button.

2. Restore Settings — Configure the following settings for the restore:

*Note: Some of the following settings will only appear if you are restoring backup data at the
item level. If the backup data is at the site or site collection level, some of these fields will not be
available.

e Conflict Resolution — Define the conflict resolution behavior. If the SharePoint object
name in the source node is the same name as an existing object in the destination node,
it is considered a conflict.

o Container level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the site
collection, site, App, list, library, and folder level.

= Skip ignores the source container that has the same name as the
destination one.

= Merge combines the configuration of the source and destination
container. If there is a conflict, the source overwrites the destination.

= Replace deletes the destination container and then restores the source
to the destination. If the selected container is a top-level site, DocAve
empties the top-level site instead of deleting it and restores the source
to the destination.

*Note: A discussion item in a discussion board list is considered a folder, so it is
restored as a container. The replies in this discussion are considered content.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

o Content level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the item level.

"" Skip ignores the source item/document that has the same item
ID/document name as the destination item/document.

="" Overwrite copies the source item/document to the destination by
overwriting the destination item/document with same item
ID/document name.

="" Overwrite by Last Modified Time keeps the conflict item\document
which has the latest modified time and overwrites the older one.

= Append an Item/Document Named with a Suffix adds the conflict
source item/document to the destination and adds a suffix to the end
of the filename. The conflict destination item/document is not deleted.

= Append a New Version adds the conflict source item/document to the
destination as a new version of the conflict destination item/document.

*Note: When the modified time of the conflict contents is the same, you can choose
whether to skip content restoration. Refer to Configuring Resolution for Content with
the Same Modified Time for details.

e Include Apps — If apps were included in the backup, choose whether or not to restore
the App and AppData. If this option is selected, you can configure Apps Conflict
Resolution settings. Otherwise, Apps Conflict Resolution does not appear.

e Apps Conflict Resolution — If the App names in the source and destination conflict, you

can choose to ""Skip"", ""Update App Only"", or ""Replace App and AppData”"" in the
destination.

oO Skip — No changes will be made; the destination App and AppData will remain
unchanged.

o Update App Only - If the App in the source is a more recent version than the
destination, it will overwrite the destination App but not the AppData.

o Replace App and AppData - The source App will always replace the destination
App and AppData. Even if the source App is an older version, it will replace the
destination App.

e Include Recycle Bin Data — Choose how to deal with the conflict resolution when the
data having the same name exists in the target Recycle Bin. Select Yes to deal with the
conflict resolution as selected in the Container level conflict resolution and Content
level conflict resolution. Select No to ignore the data having the same name in the
target Recycle Bin.

*Note: This field only appears for the following situations:

o Select Skip in the Container level conflict resolution drop-down list.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

*Note: Some of the following settings will only appear if you are restoring backup data at the

item level. If the backup data is at the site or site collection level, some of these fields will not be

available.

e Conflict Resolution — Define the conflict resolution behavior. If the SharePoint object
name in the source node is the same name as an existing object in the destination node,
it is considered a conflict.

o Container level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the site
collection, site, App, list, library, and folder level.

Skip ignores the source container that has the same name as the
destination one.

Merge combines the configuration of the source and destination
container. If there is a conflict, the source overwrites the destination.

Replace deletes the destination container and then restores the source
to the destination. If the selected container is a top-level site, DocAve
empties the top-level site instead of deleting it and restores the source
to the destination.

*Note: A discussion item in a discussion board is considered a folder, so it is

restored as a container. The replies in this discussion are considered content.

o Content level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the
item/document level.

Skip ignores the source item/document that has the same item
ID/document name as the destination item/document.

Overwrite copies the source item/document to the destination by
overwriting the destination item/document with same item
ID/document name.

Overwrite by Last Modified Time keeps the conflict item\document
which has the latest modified time and overwrites the older one.

Append an Item/Document Named with a Suffix adds the conflict
source item/document to the destination and adds “_1” to the end of
the filename. The conflict destination item/document is not deleted.

Append a New Version adds the conflict source item/document to the
destination as a new version of the conflict destination item/document.

*Note: When the modified time of the conflict contents is the same, you can choose

whether to skip content restoration. Refer to Configuring Resolution for Content with
the Same Modified Time for details.

e Include Recycle Bin Data — Choose how to deal with the conflict resolution when the
data having the same name exists in the target Recycle Bin. Select Yes to deal with the
conflict resolution as selected in the Container level conflict resolution and Content

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
level conflict resolution. Select No to ignore the data having the same name in the
target Recycle Bin.

*Note: This field only appears for the following situations:

o Select Skip in the Container level conflict resolution drop-down list.

o Select Merge in the Container level conflict resolution drop-down list and
select Skip in the Content level conflict resolution drop-down list.

e Include Apps — If apps were included in the backup, choose whether or not to restore
the App and AppData. If this option is selected, you can configure Apps Conflict
Resolution settings. Otherwise, Apps Conflict Resolution does not appear.

e Apps Conflict Resolution — If the App names in the source and destination conflict, you

can choose to ""Skip"", ""Update App Only"", or ""Replace App and AppData”"" in the
destination.

oO Skip — No changes will be made; the destination App and AppData will remain
unchanged.

o Update App Only - If the App in the source is a more recent version than the
destination, it will overwrite the destination App but not the AppData.

o Replace App and AppData - The source App will always replace the destination
App and AppData. If the source App is an older version, it will still replace the
destination App.

e Exclude User/Group Without Permission — Choose whether to exclude the user/group
without permission for the plans by selecting Yes or No. If you select Yes, the
users/groups that have no permissions will not be restored. No is selected by default.

e Job Report — Select the job report type. Select Simplified to create a summary of
content restored to SharePoint, or select Detailed to get a full list of all objects restored
to SharePoint at the cost of performance.

e Version Settings — Select the level of versions you want to restore. Choose Restore all
versions to restore all of the versions of the backup data, or choose Restore the latest
version(s) to only restore the latest Major or Major and Minor versions of the backup
data.

e User Profile — Choose whether or not to restore the user profiles that have been backed
up. Select the Restore user profiles option to restore the backed up user profiles.

e Workflow — Decide how to recover SharePoint workflow data. Select Include workflow
definition to restore the definition of the source workflows to the SharePoint container.
Select Include workflow instance to restore the state, history, and tasks of each item.

o Include completed instance(s) — This option is mandatory. The completed
instances will be restored.

o Include running instance(s) — Select this option to restore the running instances.
When selecting this option, continue to set the status of the restored instance,
cancel the workflows or restart the workflows.

e Item Depended Columns and Content Types — Choose whether to restore item-
dependent columns and content types.

*Note: If you did not select Property besides the selected node in the Data Selection
step, and the dependent column or content type does not exist in the destination, then
that column or content type will not be restored. If this is the case, use this option to
restore them.

o Restore the item-dependent columns and content types to maintain item
integrity — The item is restored and the dependent column or content type is
created in the corresponding list/library. The item still uses the dependent
column and content type. Proceed to select a conflict resolution from the
Conflict resolution for dependent items list.

o Donot restore item-dependent columns and content types — The item
dependent columns and dependent content types will not be restored. When
selecting this option, make sure the dependent columns and content types exist

Verify GUID — When an object in the backup data having the same name exists in the
destination, you can select how to deal with this situation:

o Select the Verify object GUID in backup data option to compare the object
GUID in the backup data with the object GUID in the destination. If the GUIDs
are not the same, the object in the backup data will not be restored.

o Deselect this option to not compare the GUID. The object in the backup data will
be restored.

b. Permission Level — Select the required minimum permission level for the end-user

restore: Full Control, Design, or Contribute. Only if the end user has the selected
permission level or higher to the desired SharePoint content, he/she can search out the
content from the backup data. If the end user does not have the required permission
level to the desired SharePoint content, he/she cannot search out the content or
perform the restore job.

If a site collection has Read-only (blocks additions, updates, and deletions) selected in
the Lock status for this site settings (SharePoint Central Administration > Site
Collection Quotas and Locks > Site Lock Information), the end-user can only view the
site content and does not have Full Control, Design, or Contribute permission level.
Therefore, the end-user cannot perform a search or restore operations at the selected
site collection.

Conflict Resolution — Define the conflict resolution behavior. When restoring, if the
SharePoint object name in the source node is the same as an existing object in the
destination node, it is considered a conflict.

o Container level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the list,
library, and folder level.

= Skip ignores the source container that has the same name as the
destination one.

= Merge combines the configuration of the source and destination
container. If there is a conflict, the source configuration overwrites the
destination one.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
Replace deletes the destination container and then restores the source
container to the destination.

*Note: A discussion board item is considered a folder, so it is restored as a

container.

o Content level conflict resolution — Set the conflict resolution on the item,
document, attachment level.

Skip ignores the source item/document/attachment that has the same
item ID/document name/attachment name as the destination
item/document/attachment.

Overwrite copies the source item/document/attachment to the
destination by overwriting the destination item/document/attachment
with same item ID/document name/attachment name.

Overwrite by Last Modified Time keeps the conflict
item/document/attachment which has the latest modified time and
overwrites the older one.

Additional Optional Configurations

Refer to the sections below regarding additional optional configurations in Granular Backup and

Restore.

Predefined Schemes

In order to run the backup job on a schedule, you must first configure a predefined scheme. In the
Predefined Scheme window you can view the default Weekly Scheme and the Monthly Scheme. Use
these two default schemes or create a new scheme as required. To set up a new predefined scheme,
complete the following steps:

1.

rF WN

Select the Backup tab in the Granular Backup and Restore user interface, and then click
Predefined Scheme on the ribbon. The Predefined Scheme window appears.

Click Create in the Manage group on the ribbon.
Name - Enter a name into the Predefined Scheme text box, and add an optional Description.
Schedule Settings — Click Add Schedule to set up a schedule. The Add Schedule tab appears.

Options — Select a backup type from the drop-down list. For more information, refer to the
Overview of Backup Types section.

e Full Backup — A full backup of the selected source.

e Incremental Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the data that has been added
since the last backup (whether it’s full, incremental, or differential).

e Differential Backup — A partial backup; backs up only the data that has been updated
since the last full backup.

*Note: Frequent consecutive differential backups have a tendency to repeatedly back up the
same data, which fills disk space quickly. For best results when conducting high frequency
backups, it is recommended that you use incremental backups. Incremental backups save time
and storage space by backing up only the differences between incremental backups or an
incremental backup and a full backup, instead of backing up the entire source location.

Type — Select the interval at which the backup occurs: By hour, By day, By week, or By month.

Schedule Settings — Set up the frequency for the scheduled backup job. If you select the type as
By hour, By week, or By month, you will have the option to check the Advanced checkbox to
configure more settings for the frequency. For more information, see the Advanced Predefined
Scheme Settings section below.

Range of Recurrence — Choose one of the following options to configure when to start and stop
running the recurring schedule:

e No end date - The job is run on schedule all of the time.

e End after ... occurrence(s) — The job stops running after running the entered times.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore PY
e End by - The job ends by the date you select.

Advanced Predefined Scheme Settings

The following advanced settings are available for configuring a predefined scheme:

By Hour
e Specify production time: From ... to ... — Run the backup job on the selected production

job. For example, set this option as Day 3 of every 2 months, and the backup is run on
the 3rd day of every two months.

e The...... of every ... month(s) — Select the time and the interval for the backup job. For
example, set this option as The First Monday of every 3 months, and the backup is run
on the first Monday every 3 months.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
DocAve Granular Backup and Restore Use Case

The following use case applies the procedures described in this guide to a real-world situation. These
use cases are intended to give the user an idea of when and why one would use common DocAve
Granular Backup and Restore functionality. Note that these situations assume that the DocAve platform
and applicable modules have been installed successfully, and that the prerequisite conditions are met
(appropriate permissions for the Agent account, creation of logical devices, etc.).

Configuring a Successful Backup Plan

As the head of IT, Joe is responsible for backing up his company’s SharePoint content. Traditionally, his
company would perform weekly backups of all SharePoint content using SharePoint’s native backup
functionality (through SQL server). In addition to extremely long backup windows, the backups led to
enormous storage requirements, as each full backup was almost a full terabyte of data. Further, the
company’s RPO and RTO were unacceptably long. This backup process soon became extremely
expensive for the company and impractical for Joe to manage. Joe’s solution is to implement the DocAve
platform — specifically, the Granular Backup and Restore module — into the company’s backup process.

Once the Granular Backup and Restore module is installed, Joe gets to work on configuring the backup
plan. He first sets up storage policies (see Configuring Devices and Setting Up Storage Policies). Then,
from within the Granular Backup and Restore user interface, Joe selects the Farms and Nodes as the
content he wants to back up (see Selecting Farms and Nodes). Being new to DocAve’s products, he
chooses to develop a backup plan using Using Wizard Mode in Using the Plan Builder. Now Joe has to
make a few important decisions: What kind of backup should he schedule? What should the restore
granularity level be? How often should he schedule backups, and what time of day should they run?
Should he compress the data?

Like many DocAve users, Joe chooses to run Overview of Backup Types, backing up only the data that
change between backup intervals. He chooses Incremental backups because they produce relatively
small backup files, which make storage less expensive and recovery of lost data a quicker process. Joe
selects the Item granularity level because many departments update important documents on
SharePoint on a daily basis, and Joe wants the ability to restore only one item if needed. He decides to
schedule these backups to run nightly during off-production hours so that the majority of network
resources can be dedicated to running the backup, thereby reducing the backup window even further.
Note that Joe could have decided to run the backups during production hours; he just would have had to
employ a lightweight backup methodology (such as a low compression rate for quicker backup and/or
site collection or site restore granularity, which reduce backup time but at the expense of item
granularity).

Joe’s decisions helped improve upon his company’s backup processes. By choosing to run Incremental
backups, he is able to drastically reduce the required backup storage space and, in combination with
scheduling the backups to run during off-production hours, he is able to reduce the backup window. By

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

choosing item granularity restore, Joe ensures the lowest impact to the business in the event that he
must recover lost or corrupt content.

Appendix A — Advanced Search

Advanced Search provides a quick method to locate specific objects or data within each SharePoint level
(from site collection level down to item level) to restore. You can use Advanced Search in the Time-
based Restore method.

1. On the Time-based Restore tab within the Data Selection step of the Restore Wizard, select the
object level as the search scope by clicking the object name in the data tree.

e Inthe Search group on the ribbon, click Advanced Search. The Advanced Search page
appears.

e The SharePoint object levels that equals or lower than the ones you select in the backup
tree are listed in the Level drop-down list. The value supports wildcard (*). Using
Advanced Search, you can search:

so DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore
*Note: Granular Backup and Restore for SharePoint Online supports backing up or restoring the Apps for
SharePoint. However, there are some limitations for the Apps that are not added from SharePoint App
Store:

e Because of the Client API limitation, DocAve cannot obtain the App stream stored in the
Microsoft server database. Therefore, DocAve cannot automatically create an App
definition in the destination App Catalog Site Collection.

o When backing up the App definition, DocAve cannot back up all of the App
definition's installation components. Instead, DocAve obtains and backs up
some properties, such as the Product ID, Product Version, and so on.

o An App definition that is the same as the source one must exist in the
destination App Catalog Site Collection so that DocAve can restore the source

App and AppData normally.

e Make sure that the user who registered all of the site collections under the My
Registered Sites node in the tree has the Read or above permission to the Apps for
SharePoint library in the App Catalog Site Collection. Otherwise, DocAve cannot load
the Apps node in the tree.

Due to the limitations mentioned above, the Update App Only in Apps Conflict Resolution setting is not
currently supported. If you select the Update App Only in Apps Conflict Resolution setting, the job will
directly skip.

Workflow Restore Notes

To restore the workflow definition and instance, make sure you have selected the related checkboxes
(Include Workflow Definition and Include Workflow Instance) when performing the backup job and
also you must select the related checkboxes in Workflow field when performing a restore job. Note that
the Replace or Merge for Container level conflict resolution in the Restore Settings must be selected.

In the Workflow section, select the options as introduced below:

e Workflow Definition — The user-created workflow definition in the site, list, or library.
SharePoint built-in workflows, workflows defined by SharePoint Designer, and
workflows defined by Nintex are supported. Workflows defined by Visio Studio are not
supported.

e Workflow Instance — The item instance created upon the triggering of a workflow
definition. This includes the workflow state, workflow history, and workflow tasks. In
the Restore Wizard, you can choose whether or not to restore the running workflow
instances from the backup data to the destination, and continue to set the status of the
restored instances, cancel the workflows or restart the workflows.

In order to restore the workflow definition and workflow instance correctly, the following requirements
must be met:

e The workflow definition must be restored to the destination farm before restoring the
workflow instance.

e The workflow feature must be enabled before you restore the workflow definition and
workflow instance.

*Note: Granular Backup and Restore does not support restoring the workflow instance for SharePoint
Online environment.

Restoring Workflow Definitions

If there is an existing destination workflow definition having the same name as the one in the source,
then the backed-up workflow definition will be restored to the destination when selecting Replace;
when selecting Merge or Skip, the backed-up workflow definition will not be restored.

Restoring Workflow Instances

If the content where the workflow instance is based on skips being restored to the destination, the
workflow instance will not be restored. If the content is restored to the destination and there is an
existing destination workflow definition having the same name as the one in the source, the backed up
workflow instance will be restored to the destination.

If there is no workflow definition in the destination for the restored workflow instance, it is skipped and
the corresponding information is recorded under the Configuration Details tab in Job Details.

AgentCommonWrapperConfig.config

Configure the AgentCommonWrapperConfig.config file to configure whether to restore custom
properties in the SharePoint property bag.

Go to the machines that have DocAve Agent installed on them and open the
... \AvePoint\DocAve6\Agent\bin directory to find the AgentCommonWrapperConfig.config file.

Restoring Entered Web Properties

Open the AgentCommonWrapperConfig.config file and find the WrapperCommon node. Within this
node, find the <RestoredAllWebProperties>False</RestoredAllWebProperties> node and the
<SpecialWebPropertyNames></SpecialWebPropertyNames> node. These two nodes are added to the
configuration file automatically when you first run a Granular Backup and Restore job.

e If you do not want to restore custom properties in the property bag, use the default
False value. When using the False value, you can also add the specific custom properties
in the SpecialWebPropertyNames node, and the custom properties you entered will be
restored. Use a semicolon to separate the custom properties. For example,
<SpecialWebPropertyNames>property1; property 2;
property3</SpecialWebPropertyNames>.

*Note: The build-in properties in property bag are all restored.

e If you want to restore all properties including the custom and build-in properties,
change False to True. When using the True value, you can add the specific properties in
the SpecialWebPropertyNames node, and the properties you entered will not be
restored.

$P2010GranularBackupRestore.cfg and
$P2013GranularBackupRestore.cfg

Configure the SP2010GranularBackupRestore.cfg/SP2013GranularBackupRestore.cfg file to configure
the following configurations:

e Whether to back up and restore the stubs (generated when using Connection or Storage
Manager) and the data related to the stubs.

e How to deal with the conflict contents when they have the same modified time.

Backing Up and Restoring Stubs and Related Data

Go to the machines that have DocAve Agent installed on them and open the
... \AvePoint\DocAve6\Agent\data\SP2010\Item directory to find the SP2010GranularBackupRestore.cfg

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

file. The SP2013GranularBackupRestore.cfg file is located in the
... \AvePoint\DocAve6\Agent\data\SP2013\Item directory.

Backing Up Stubs and the Related Data
Find the backupSOData attribute and modify the value of the attribute to configure the backup settings.

e Skip — Do not back up any stubs. The data related to the stubs is also not backed up.

e OnlyBackupContent — Only back up the data related to the stubs. The stubs are not
backed up.
e OnlyBackupStubs — Only back up the stubs. The data related to the stubs is not backed
up.
Restoring Stubs and the Related Data

Find the restoreSOData attribute and modify the value of the attribute to configure the restoring
settings.

e true — Both the backed up stubs and the backed up data related to the stubs will be
restored. When you only backed up the stubs, it is only supported to use In Place
Restore to restore the stubs. Otherwise, the stubs cannot be restored.

Restore the stubs after you have run a Clean Up Orphan BLOBs job (this job removes
orphan BLOB content in the external storage after the corresponding stubs are removed
from SharePoint). Granular Restore can restore the stubs successfully and make these
stubs connect to the related BLOB content in the external storage after the BLOBs are
restore to the external storage by customer.

e false — Both the stubs and the data related to the stubs will not be restored.

Configuring Resolution for Content with the Same Modified Time

Configure the SP2010GranularBackupRestore.cfg or SP2013GranularBackupRestore.cfg file to
configure behavior when contents in the source and destination have the same modified time.

Go to the machines that have DocAve Agents installed on them and open the

... \AvePoint\DocAve6\Agent\data\SP2010\Item directory to find the SP2010GranularBackupRestore.cfg
file. The SP2013GranularBackupRestore.cfg file is located in the

... \AvePoint\DocAve6\Agent\data\SP2013\Item directory.

In the file, find the SkiplfSameModified attribute. Modify the value of this attribute.

e true —The backed up item/document will be skipped and not be restored.

e false (default) — The backed up item/document will be restored according to the
resolution you select from the Content level conflict resolution drop-down list when
configuring the Restore Settings.

© Skip — The backed up item/document will not be restored.

DocAve 6: Granular Backup and Restore

o Overwrite — Overwrites the destination item/document with the backed-up

OVERVIEW

Tzunami Documentum Exporter enables migrating Documentum content into SharePoint
Server 2013/SharePoint Foundation 2013 (SPS2013/SPF2013), SharePoint Microsoft Office
365, SharePoint Server 2010/SharePoint Foundation 2010 (SPS2010/SPF2010), Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007/Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (MOSS/WSS3.0), or
Microsoft SharePoint Portal Server 2003/Windows SharePoint Services 2.0
(SPS2003/WSS2.0) using Tzunami Deployer.

To load Documentum content into Tzunami Deployer, you must first extract the content,
using Tzunami Documentum Exporter, into TDX (Tzunami Deployer Export) and STDX
(Separate Tzunami Deployer Export) files. You can then load this TDX file into a Deployer
project.

Ke) When working with Tzunami Deployer on several machines, you can run an export on one
machine and load the exported data on another.

Tzunami Documentum Exporter is distributed as an external tool from Tzunami Deployer.

Supported Types

The following items are exported from Documentum:
¢ Cabinets (General and Personal)
e Folders
¢ Documents (including custom types)

¢ Virtual Documents

\ , Virtual Documents are converted to Folders.

Each item is assigned an ACL defining the permissions of the various members
according to the roles they were assigned.

The exporter automatically creates four default roles that are used during the
deployment process. The roles include Reader (Browse and Read permissions),
Contributor (Browse, Read, Relate and Note permissions), Web Designer (Browse,
Read, Relate, Note, Version, Write and Delete permissions), and Administrator (user
has full permissions).

EXPORTING FROM DOCUMENTUM

The Tzunami Documentum Exporter enables you to export Documentum content to a TDX
file.

Export in small chunks: When exporting from your source system, perform the export in small chunks
of about 40K-50K files each that have a common business logic or some other logic.

Ensure consistency: Make sure that the content of the different exports does not overlap and that,
while exporting, no changes are made to the source data.
To export to a TDX file:

1. In Tzunami Deployer, Right-Click in the Documentum tab source store area and
select Export Documentum to TDX.

Or
Click Start > All Programs > Tzunami > Tzunami Documentum Exporter

COMMAND-LINE EXPORT

Tzunami Exporter for Documentum provides ability to run export sessions non-interactively
using command line instructions. This allows administrators to plan and schedule long
running migration jobs through scripts, batch files and schedulers according to needs and
organizational timetables. To run the exporter in batch mode you will need exporter
specification file explained in the ‘Choose Destination Folder’ step of the export wizard. The
file contains all the export option details including:

¢ Source ECM connectivity information (Server Address, User Name, Password etc.)
e Items to export

¢ Destination and Log Folder

e Filter

Tandy

Migration Masters
e Exporter specific options

This file can be edited to suit your needs however the XML schema of the file should not be
altered. It is recommended that you generate a sample specifications file in the Destination
Folder Screen selection step of the export wizard and use it as a template to create your own
specification file.

Once the specification file is ready, you can run the exporter from command line using
command:

TzunamiExporter.exe [-r <ResultFile>] -s <ExportSpecificationsFile>

Usage
Field Description
-r Outputs export results into an XML file [Optional]
-S XML file containing export specifications

For example:

C:\User\Administrator> “C:\Program Files (x86)\Tzunami\Deployer
2.8\Exporters\Documentum\TzunamiExporter.exe” -s “D:\Spec Files\specs1.xml”

C:\Program Files (x86)\Tzunami\Deployer 2.8\Exporters\Documentum>
TzunamiExporter.exe -s “D:\Spec Files\specs1.xml”

Based on your needs you can create number of specification files and use them to run
multiple export sessions as batch commands.

You will need to provide absolute path for TzunamiExporter.exe and ExportSpecificationsFile
in the command if you are not running from the exporter installation directory.

In Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 environment, if USG (Universal
Security Group) is enabled, Users with low privileges sometimes cannot export ECM
contents. To export contents using command line, User must run with elevated or
administrative privileges.

To export contents with elevated or administrative privileges, you can run the exporter from
command line using command:

RUNAS /trustlevel: “Unrestricted” “<ExporterInstallationDirectory>\TzunamiExporter.exe”
-s “<Spec file path>\Specfilename.xml” ”

For example:

C:\> RUNAS /trustlevel:“Unrestricted” “C:\Program Files (x86)\Tzunami\Deployer
2.8\Exporters\Documentum\TzunamiExporter.exe “ -s “D:\Spec Files\specs1.xml”
